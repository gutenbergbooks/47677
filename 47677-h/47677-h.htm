    <h2>
      BOOK THE FIRST.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>hould any one of
      the people not know the art of loving, let him read me; and taught by me,
      on reading my lines, let him love. By art the ships are onward sped by
      sails and oars; by art are the light chariots, by art is Love, to be
      guided. In the chariot and in the flowing reins was Automedon skilled: in
      the Hæmonian ship <i>of Jason</i> Tiphys was the pilot. Me, too, skilled
      in my craft, has Venus made the guardian of Love. Of Cupid the Tiphys and
      the Automedon shall I be styled. Unruly indeed he is, and one who oft
      rebels against me; but he is a child; his age is tender and easy to be
      governed. The son of Phillyra made the boy Achilles skilled at the lyre;
      and with his soothing art he subdued his ferocious disposition. He who so
      oft alarmed his own companions, so oft the foe, is believed to have stood
      in dread of an aged man full of years. Those hands which Hector was doomed
      to feel, at the request of his master he held out for stripes <a
      href="#linknote-701" name="linknoteref-701" id="linknoteref-701"><small>701</small></a>
      as commanded. Chiron was the preceptor of the grandson of Æacus, I of
      Love. Both of the boys were wild; both of a Goddess born. But yet the neck
      of even the bull is laden with the plough; and the reins are champed by
      the teeth of the spirited steed. To me, too, will Love yield; though, with
      his bow, he should wound my breast, and should brandish his torches hurled
      against me. The more that Love has pierced me, the more has he
      relentlessly inflamed me; so much the fitter avenger shall I be of the
      wounds so made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phoebus, I pretend not that these arts were bestowed on me by thee; nor by
      the notes of the birds of the air am I inspired. Neither Clio nor the
      sisters of Clio have been beheld by me, while watching, Ascra, in thy
      vales, my flocks. To this work experience gives rise; listen to a Poet
      well-versed. The truth will I sing; Mother of Love, favour my design. Be
      ye afar, <a href="#linknote-702" name="linknoteref-702"
      id="linknoteref-702"><small>702</small></a> ye with the thin fillets on
      your hair, the mark of chastity; and thou, long flounce, which dost
      conceal the middle of the foot. We will sing of guiltless delights, and of
      thefts allowed; and in my song there shall be nought that is criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, endeavour to find out an object which you may desire
      to love, you who are now coming for the first time to engage as a soldier
      in a new service. The next task after that, is to prevail on the fair by
      pleasing her. The third is, for her love to prove of long duration. This
      is my plan; this space shall be marked out by my chariot; this the
      turning-place to be grazed by my wheels in their full career.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you may, and while you are able to proceed with flowing reins;
      choose one to whom you may say, "You alone are pleasing to me." She will
      not come to you gliding through the yielding air; the fair one that suits
      must be sought with your eyes. The hunter knows full well where to extend
      the toils for the deer; full well he knows in what vale dwells the boar
      gnashing with his teeth. The shrubberies are known to the fowlers. He who
      holds out the hooks, knows what waters are swam in by many a fish. You,
      too, who seek a subject for enduring love, first learn in what spot the
      fair are to be met with. In your search, I will not bid you give your
      sails to the wind, nor is a long path to be trodden by you, that you may
      find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Perseus bear away his Andromeda from the tawny Indians, <a
      href="#linknote-703" name="linknoteref-703" id="linknoteref-703"><small>703</small></a>
      and let the Grecian fair be ravished by Paris, the Phrygian hero. Rome
      will present you damsels as many, and full as fair; so that you will
      declare, that whatever has been on the earth, she possesses. As many ears
      of corn as Gargara has, as many clusters as Methymna; as many fishes as
      are concealed in the seas, birds in the boughs; as many stars as <a
      href="#linknote-704" name="linknoteref-704" id="linknoteref-704"><small>704</small></a>
      heaven has, so many fair ones does your own Rome contain; and in her own
      City does the mother of Æneas hold her reign. Are you charmed by early and
      still dawning years, the maiden in all her genuineness will come before
      your eyes; or do you wish a riper fair, <a href="#linknote-705"
      name="linknoteref-705" id="linknoteref-705"><small>705</small></a> a
      thousand riper will please you; you will be forced not to know which is
      your own choice. Or does an age mature and more staid delight you; this
      throng too, believe me, will be even greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you only saunter at your leisure in the shade of Pompey's Portico, <a
      href="#linknote-706" name="linknoteref-706" id="linknoteref-706"><small>706</small></a>
      when the sun approaches the back of the Lion of Hercules; <a
      href="#linknote-707" name="linknoteref-707" id="linknoteref-707"><small>707</small></a>
      or where the mother <a href="#linknote-708" name="linknoteref-708"
      id="linknoteref-708"><small>708</small></a> has added her own gifts to
      those of her son, a work rich in its foreign marble. And let not the
      Portico of Livia <a href="#linknote-709" name="linknoteref-709"
      id="linknoteref-709"><small>709</small></a> be shunned by you, which, here
      and there adorned with ancient paintings, bears the name of its founder.
      Where, too, are the grand-daughters of Be-lus, <a href="#linknote-710"
      name="linknoteref-710" id="linknoteref-710"><small>710</small></a> who
      dared to plot death for their wretched cousins, and where their enraged
      father stands with his drawn sword. Nor let Adonis, bewailed by Venus, <a
      href="#linknote-711" name="linknoteref-711" id="linknoteref-711"><small>711</small></a>
      escape you; and the seventh holy-day observed by the Jew of Syria. <a
      href="#linknote-712" name="linknoteref-712" id="linknoteref-712"><small>712</small></a>
      Nor fly from the Memphian temples of Isis the linen-wearing heifer; she
      has made many a woman <a href="#linknote-713" name="linknoteref-713"
      id="linknoteref-713"><small>713</small></a> that which she was herself to
      Jove. Even the Courts, (who would have believed it?) are favourable to
      Love; and oft in the noisy Forum has the flame been found. Where the
      erection <a href="#linknote-714" name="linknoteref-714"
      id="linknoteref-714"><small>714</small></a> of Appius, <a
      href="#linknote-715" name="linknoteref-715" id="linknoteref-715"><small>715</small></a>
      adjoining the temple of Venus, built of marble, beats the air with its
      shooting stream; <a href="#linknote-716" name="linknoteref-716"
      id="linknoteref-716"><small>716</small></a> in that spot full oft is the
      pleader seized by Love; and he that has defended others, the same does not
      defend himself. Oft in that spot are their words found wanting to the
      eloquent man; and new cares arise, and his own cause has to be pleaded.
      From her temple, which is adjoining, <a href="#linknote-717"
      name="linknoteref-717" id="linknoteref-717"><small>717</small></a> Venus
      laughs at him. He who so lately was a patron, now wishes to become a
      client.
    </p>
    <p>
      But especially at the curving Theatres do you hunt for prey: these places
      are even yet more fruitful for your desires. There you will find what you
      may love, what you may trifle with, both what you may once touch, and what
      you may wish to keep. As the numberless ants come and go in lengthened
      train, when they are carrying their wonted food in the mouth that bears
      the grains; or as the bees, when they have found both their own pastures
      and the balmy meads, hover around the flowers and the tops of the thyme;
      so rush the best-dressed women to the thronged spectacles; a multitude
      that oft has kept my judgment in suspense. They come to see, they come
      that they themselves may be seen; to modest chastity these spots are
      detrimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Romulus, 'twas thou didst first institute the exciting games; at the time
      when the ravished Sabine fair <a href="#linknote-718"
      name="linknoteref-718" id="linknoteref-718"><small>718</small></a> came to
      the aid of the solitary men. Then, neither did curtains <a
      href="#linknote-719" name="linknoteref-719" id="linknoteref-719"><small>719</small></a>
      hang over the marble theatre, <a href="#linknote-720"
      name="linknoteref-720" id="linknoteref-720"><small>720</small></a> nor was
      the stage <a href="#linknote-721" name="linknoteref-721"
      id="linknoteref-721"><small>721</small></a> blushing with liquid saffron.
      There, the branches were simply arranged which the woody Palatium bore;
      the scene was void of art. On the steps made of turf sit the people; the
      branches promiscuously overshadowing their shaggy locks. They look about
      them, and they mark with their eyes, each for himself, the damsel which to
      choose; and in their silent minds they devise full many a plan. And while,
      as the Etrurian piper sends forth his harsh notes, the actor with his foot
      thrice beats the levelled ground; in the midst of the applause, (in those
      days applause was void of guile,) the King gives to his people the signal
      to be awaited for the spoil. At once, they start up, and, disclosing their
      intentions with a shout, lay their greedy hands upon the maidens. <a
      href="#linknote-722" name="linknoteref-722" id="linknoteref-722"><small>722</small></a>
      As the doves, a startled throng, fly from the eagles, and as the young
      Iamb flies from the wolves when seen; in such manner do they dread the men
      indiscriminately rushing on; the complexion remains in none, which existed
      there before. For their fear is the same; the symptoms of their fear not
      the same. Some tear their hair; some sit without consciousness; one is
      silent in her grief; another vainly calls upon her mother; this one
      laments; this one is astounded; this one tarries; that one takes to
      flight. The ravished fair ones are carried off, a matrimonial spoil; and
      shame itself may have been becoming to many a one. If one struggled
      excessively, and repelled her companion; borne off, the man himself lifted
      her into his eager bosom. And thus he spoke: "Why spoil your charming eyes
      with tears? What to your mother your father was, the same will I be to
      you." Romulus, 'twas thou alone didst understand how to give rewards to
      thy soldiers. Give such a reward to me, and I will be a soldier. In good
      truth, from that transaction, the festive Theatres, even to this day,
      continue to be treacherous to the handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let not the contest of the noble steeds escape you; the roomy Circus
      of the people has many advantages. There is no need there of fingers, with
      which to talk over your secrets; nor must a hint be taken by you through
      nods. Be seated next to your mistress, there being no one to prevent it;
      press your side to her side as close as ever you can; and conveniently
      enough, because the partition <a href="#linknote-723"
      name="linknoteref-723" id="linknoteref-723"><small>723</small></a> compels
      you to sit close, even if she be unwilling; and because, by the custom of
      the place, the fair one must be touched by you. Here let the occasion be
      sought by you for some friendly chat, and let the usual subjects <a
      href="#linknote-724" name="linknoteref-724" id="linknoteref-724"><small>724</small></a>
      lead to the first words. Take care, and enquire, with an air of Anxiety,
      whose horses those are, coming; and without delay, whoever it is to whom
      she wishes well, to him do you also wish well. But when the thronged
      procession shall walk with the holy statues of ivory, <a
      href="#linknote-725" name="linknoteref-725" id="linknoteref-725"><small>725</small></a>
      do you applaud your mistress Venus with zealous hand. And, as often
      happens, if perchance a little dust should fall on the bosom of the fair,
      it must be brushed off with your fingers <a href="#linknote-726"
      name="linknoteref-726" id="linknoteref-726"><small>726</small></a> and if
      there should be no dust, still brush off that none; let any excuse be a
      prelude to your attentions. If her mantle, hanging too low, shall be
      trailing on the earth, gather it up, and carefully raise it from the dirty
      ground. <a href="#linknote-727" name="linknoteref-727" id="linknoteref-727"><small>727</small></a>
      At once, as the reward of your attention, the fair permitting it, her
      ancles will chance to be seen by your eyes. Look, too, behind, who shall
      be sitting behind you, that he may not press her tender back with his knee
      against it. <a href="#linknote-728" name="linknoteref-728"
      id="linknoteref-728"><small>728</small></a> Trifles attract trifling
      minds. It has proved to the advantage of many a one, to make a cushion
      with his ready hand. <a href="#linknote-729" name="linknoteref-729"
      id="linknoteref-729"><small>729</small></a> It has been of use, too, to
      waft a breeze with the graceful fan, and to place the hollow footstool
      beneath her delicate feet. Both the Circus, and the sand spread for its
      sad duties <a href="#linknote-730" name="linknoteref-730"
      id="linknoteref-730"><small>730</small></a> in the bustling Forum, will
      afford these overtures to a dawning passion. On that sand, oft has the son
      of Venus fought; and he who has come to be a spectator of wounds, himself
      receives a wound. <a href="#linknote-731" name="linknoteref-731"
      id="linknoteref-731"><small>731</small></a> While he is talking, and is
      touching her hand, and is asking for the racing list; <a
      href="#linknote-732" name="linknoteref-732" id="linknoteref-732"><small>732</small></a>
      and, having deposited the stake, <a href="#linknote-733"
      name="linknoteref-733" id="linknoteref-733"><small>733</small></a> is
      enquiring which has conquered, wounded, he sighs, and feels the flying
      dart, and, himself, becomes a portion of the spectacle so viewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides; when, of late, <a href="#linknote-734" name="linknoteref-734"
      id="linknoteref-734"><small>734</small></a> Cæsar, on the representation
      of a rival fight, introduced <a href="#linknote-735" name="linknoteref-735"
      id="linknoteref-735"><small>735</small></a> the Persian and Athenian
      ships; in truth, from both seas came youths, from both came the fair; and
      in the City was the whole of the great world. Who, in that throng, did not
      find an object for him to love? How many, alas! did a foreign flame
      torment? See! Cæsar prepares <a href="#linknote-736" name="linknoteref-736"
      id="linknoteref-736"><small>736</small></a> to add what was wanting to the
      world subdued; now, remote East, our own shalt thou be! Parthian, thou
      shalt give satisfaction; entombed Crassi, rejoice; <a href="#linknote-737"
      name="linknoteref-737" id="linknoteref-737"><small>737</small></a> ye
      standards, too, that disgracefully submitted to barbarian hands. Your
      avenger is at hand, and proves himself a general in his earliest years;
      and, while a boy, is conducting a war not fitted to be waged by a boy.
      Cease, in your fears, to count the birth-days of the Gods: <a
      href="#linknote-738" name="linknoteref-738" id="linknoteref-738"><small>738</small></a>
      valour is the lot of the Cæsars, in advance of their years. The divine
      genius rises more rapidly than its years, and brooks not the evils of slow
      delay. The Tirynthian hero was a baby, and he crushed two serpents in his
      hands; even in his cradle he was already worthy of Jove. Bacchus, who even
      now art a boy, how mighty wast thou then, when conquered India dreaded thy
      thyrsi! With the auspices and the courage of thy sire, thou, Youth, shalt
      wield arms; and with the courage and the auspices of thy sire shalt thou
      conquer. Such first lessons are thy due, under a name so great; now the
      first of the youths, <a href="#linknote-739" name="linknoteref-739"
      id="linknoteref-739"><small>739</small></a> at a future day to be the
      first of the men. Since thou hast brothers, <a href="#linknote-740"
      name="linknoteref-740" id="linknoteref-740"><small>740</small></a> avenge
      thy brethren slain; and since thou hast a sire, <a href="#linknote-741"
      name="linknoteref-741" id="linknoteref-741"><small>741</small></a>
      vindicate the rights of thy sire. He, the father of thy country and thine
      own, hath put thee in arms; the enemy is tearing realms away from thy
      reluctant sire. Thou wilt wield the weapons of duty, the foe arrows
      accursed; before thy standard, Justice and Duty will take their post. By
      the badness of their cause, the Parthians are conquered; in arms, too, may
      they be overcome; may my hero add to Latium the wealth of the East. Both
      thou, father Mars, and thou, father Cæsar, grant your divine favour as he
      sets out; for the one of you is now a Deity, thou, the other, wilt so be.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, Parthian, dost thou leave to the conquered, who dost fly that thou
      mayst overcome? Parthian, even now has thy mode of warfare an unhappy
      omen. And will that day then come, on which thou, the most graceful of all
      objects, glittering with gold, shalt go, drawn by the four snow-white
      steeds? Before thee shall walk the chiefs, their necks laden with chains;
      that they may no longer, as formerly, be secure in flight. The joyous
      youths, and the mingled fair, shall be looking on; and that day shall
      gladden the minds of all. And when some one of the fair shall enquire the
      names of the Monarchs, what places, what mountains, or what rivers are
      borne in the procession; answer to it all; and not only if she shall make
      any inquiry; even what you know not, relate, as though known perfectly
      well. *

      This is the Euphrates, <a href="#linknote-742" name="linknoteref-742"
      id="linknoteref-742"><small>742</small></a> with his forehead encircled
      with reeds; the one whose <a href="#linknote-743" name="linknoteref-743"
      id="linknoteref-743"><small>743</small></a> azure hair is streaming down,
      will be the Tigris. Make these to be the Armenians; this is Persia, sprung
      from Danaë; <a href="#linknote-744" name="linknoteref-744"
      id="linknoteref-744"><small>744</small></a> that was a city in the vales
      of Achæ-menes. This one or that will be the leaders; and there will be
      names for you to call them by; correctly, if you can; if not, still by
      such as suggest themselves.

      Banquets, too, with the tables arranged, afford an introduction; there is
      something there besides wine for you to look for. Full oft does blushing
      Cupid, with his delicate arms, press the soothed horns of Bacchus there
      present. And when the wine has besprinkled the soaking wings of Cupid,
      there he remains and stands overpowered on the spot of his capture. He,
      indeed, quickly flaps his moistened wings; but still it is fatal <a
      href="#linknote-745" name="linknoteref-745" id="linknoteref-745"><small>745</small></a>
      for the breast to be sprinkled by Love. Wine composes to choose an object
      for you to love, where to lay your nets. Now, I attempt to teach you, by
      what arts she must be captured who has pleased you, a work of especial
      skill. Ye men, whoever you are, and in every spot, give attention eager to
      be informed; and give, all people, a favourable ear to the realization of
      my promises. First of all, let a confidence enter your mind, that all
      women may be won; you will win them; do you only lay your toils. Sooner
      would the birds be silent in spring, the grasshoppers in summer, sooner
      would the Mænalian dog turn its back upon the hare, than the fair,
      attentively courted, would resist the youth. She, however, will wish you
      to believe, so far as you can, that she is reluctant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo! I utter a prophecy; thou wilt conquer, and I shall offer the lines
      which I have vowed; and with a loud voice wilt thou have to be celebrated
      by me. Thou wilt there he taking thy stand, and in my words thou wilt be
      animating thy troops. O that my words may not prove unworthy of thy
      spirit! I will celebrate both the backs of the Parthians as they fly, and
      the valour of the Romans, and the darts and the feelings, and makes them
      ready to be inflamed; care flies, and is drenched with plenteous wine.
      Then come smiles; then the poor man resumes his confidence then grief and
      cares and the wrinkles of the forehead depart. Then candour, most uncommon
      in our age, reveals the feelings, the God expelling <i>all</i> guile. On
      such occasions, full oft have the fair captivated the hearts of the
      youths; and Venus amid wine, has proved flames in flame. Here do not you
      trust too much to the deceiving lamp; <a href="#linknote-746"
      name="linknoteref-746" id="linknoteref-746"><small>746</small></a> both
      night and wine are unsuited to a judgment upon beauty. In daylight, and
      under a clear sky, did Paris view the Goddesses, when he said to Venus:
      "Thou, Venus, dost excel them both." By night, blemishes are concealed,
      and pardon is granted to every imperfection; and that hour renders every
      woman beauteous. Consult the daylight about jewels, about wool steeped in
      purple; consult the daylight about the figure and the proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why enumerate the resorts of fair ones suited for your search? The sands
      would yield to my number. Why mention Baiæ, <a href="#linknote-747"
      name="linknoteref-747" id="linknoteref-747"><small>747</small></a> and the
      shores covered with sails, and the waters which send forth the smoke from
      the warm sulphur? Many a one carrying thence a wound in his breast, has
      exclaimed; "This water was not so wholesome as it was said to be." See,
      too, the temple in the grove of suburban Diana, and the realms acquired
      with the sword by hostile hand. <a href="#linknote-748"
      name="linknoteref-748" id="linknoteref-748"><small>748</small></a> Because
      she is a virgin, because she hates the darts of Cupid, she has given many
      a wound to the public, <i>and</i> will give many <i>still.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far, Thalia borne upon unequal wheels, <a href="#linknote-749"
      name="linknoteref-749" id="linknoteref-749"><small>749</small></a> teaches
      where the foeman hurls from his flying steed.

      As stealthy courtship is pleasing to the man, so, too, is it to the fair.
      The man but unsuccessfully conceals his passion; with more concealment
      does she desire. Were it agreed among the males not to be the first to
      entreat any female, the conquered fair would soon act the part of the
      suppliant. In the balmy meads, the female lows after the bull; the female
      is always neighing after the horny-hoofed horse. Passion in us is more
      enduring, and not so violent; among men the flame has reasonable bounds.
      Why mention Byblis, who burned with a forbidden passion for her brother,
      and who resolutely atoned with the halter for her crimes? Myrrha loved her
      father, but not as a daughter ought; and she now lies hid, overwhelmed by
      the bark <a href="#linknote-750" name="linknoteref-750"
      id="linknoteref-750"><small>750</small></a> that grew over her. With her
      tears too, which she distils from the odoriferous tree, are we perfumed;
      and the drops still retain the name of their mistress.

      By chance, in the shady vales of the woody Ida, there was a white hull,
      the glory of the herd, marked with a little black in the middle between
      his horns; there was but one spot; the rest was of the complexion of milk.
      The heifers of Gnossus and of Cydon <a href="#linknote-751"
      name="linknoteref-751" id="linknoteref-751"><small>751</small></a> sighed
      to mate with him. Pasiphaë delighted to become the paramour of the bull;
      in her jealousy she hated the beauteous cows. I sing of facts well known:
      Crete, which contains its hundred cities, untruthful as it is, <a
      href="#linknote-752" name="linknoteref-752" id="linknoteref-752"><small>752</small></a>
      cannot gainsay them. She herself is said to have cut down fresh leaves and
      the tenderest grass with hand unused to such employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She goes as the companion of the herds; so going, no regard for her
      husband restrains her; and by a bull <a href="#linknote-753"
      name="linknoteref-753" id="linknoteref-753"><small>753</small></a> is
      Minos conquered. "Of what use, Pasiphaë, is it to put on those costly
      garments? This love of thine understands nothing about wealth. What hast
      thou to do with a mirror, when accompanying the herds of the mountain?
      Why, foolish one, art thou so often arranging thy smoothed locks? Still,
      do thou believe that mirror, that denies that thou art a heifer. How much
      couldst thou wish for horns to spring up upon thy forehead! If Minos still
      pleases thee, let no paramour be sought; but if thou wouldst rather
      deceive thy husband, deceive him through a being that is human."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her chamber abandoned, the queen is borne over the groves and the forests,
      just as a Bacchanal impelled by the Aonian God. Alas! how oft with jealous
      look does she eye a cow, and say, "Why is she thus pleasing to my love?
      See how she skips before him on the tender grass! I make no doubt that the
      fool thinks that it is becoming to her." Thus she spoke, and at once
      ordered her to be withdrawn from the vast herd, and, in her innocence, to
      be dragged beneath the bending yoke; or else she forced her to fall before
      the altars, and rites feigned for the purpose; and, with joyous hand, she
      held the entrails of her rival. How often did she propitiate the Deities
      with her slain rivals, and say, as she held the entrails, "Now go and
      charm my love!" And sometimes she begged that she might become Europa,
      sometimes Io; because the one was a cow, the other borne upon a bull.
      Still, deceived by a cow made of maple-wood, the leader of the herd
      impregnated her; and by the offspring was the sire <a href="#linknote-754"
      name="linknoteref-754" id="linknoteref-754"><small>754</small></a>
      betrayed.
    </p>

      If the Cretan dame <a href="#linknote-755" name="linknoteref-755"
      id="linknoteref-755"><small>755</small></a> had withheld from love for
      Thyestes (alas! how hard it is for a woman possibly to be pleasing to one
      man only!) Phoebus would not have interrupted his career in the midst,
      and, his chariot turned back, retreated, with his returning steeds, to the
      morn. The daughter, who spoiled <a href="#linknote-756"
      name="linknoteref-756" id="linknoteref-756"><small>756</small></a> Nisus
      of his purple locks, presses beneath her thigh and groin the raving dogs.
      The son of Atreus, who escaped from Mars by land, and Neptune on the
      waves, was the mournful victim of his wife. By whom have not been lamented
      the flames <a href="#linknote-757" name="linknoteref-757"
      id="linknoteref-757"><small>757</small></a> of the Ephyrean Creusa? Medea,
      the parent, too, stained with the blood of her children? Phoenix, the son
      of Amyntor, <a href="#linknote-758" name="linknoteref-758"
      id="linknoteref-758"><small>758</small></a> wept with his blinded eyes;
      you, startled steeds, tore Hippolytus in pieces. Why, Phineus, dost thou
      tear out the eyes of thy guiltless sons? <a href="#linknote-759"
      name="linknoteref-759" id="linknoteref-759"><small>759</small></a> That
      punishment will revert to thy own head.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things have been caused by the passion of females. It is more
      violent than ours, and has more frenzy <i>in it</i>. Come then, and doubt
      not that you can conquer all the fair: out of so many, there will be
      hardly one to deny you. What they yield, and what they refuse, still are
      they glad to be asked for. Even if you are deceived, your repulse is
      without danger. But why should you be deceived, since new pleasures are
      delightful, and since what is strange attracts the feelings more than what
      is one's own? <a href="#linknote-760" name="linknoteref-760"
      id="linknoteref-760"><small>760</small></a> The crop <a
      href="#linknote-761" name="linknoteref-761" id="linknoteref-761"><small>761</small></a>
      of corn is always more fertile in the fields of other people; and the
      herds of our neighbours have their udders more distended.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first, be it your care to make acquaintance with the handmaid of the
      fair one to be courted; she can render your access easy. <a
      href="#linknote-762" name="linknoteref-762" id="linknoteref-762"><small>762</small></a>
      Take care that she is deep in the secrets of her mistress, and not too
      little entrusted with her secret frolics. Her do you bribe with promises,
      her with entreaties; you will obtain what you ask with little trouble, if
      she shall be willing. Let her choose the time (physicians, even, watch
      their time) when the feelings of her mistress are pliant, and easy to be
      influenced. Then will her feelings be easily influenced, when, in the best
      humour in the world, she shall be smiling, just as the corn on the rich
      soil. While hearts are joyous, and not closed by sadness, <i>then</i> are
      they assailable; then with soothing arts does Venus steal on apace. At the
      time when Troy was in sorrow, she was defended by arms; when joyous, she
      admitted the horse pregnant with its soldiers. Then, too, must she be
      assailed, when she shall be fretting on being offended by a rival; then
      effect it by your means that she go not unrevenged. Let her handmaid, as
      she combs her hair in the morning, urge her on; and to the sail let her
      add the resources of the oar. And, sighing to herself, let her say, in
      gentle murmurs: "In my idea, you yourself cannot pay him in return." <a
      href="#linknote-763" name="linknoteref-763" id="linknoteref-763"><small>763</small></a>
      Then let her talk about you; then let her add persuasive expressions; and
      let her swear that you are perishing with frantic passion. But speed on,
      let not the sails fall, and the breezes lull: like brittle ice, anger
      disappears in lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      You inquire if it is of use <a href="#linknote-764" name="linknoteref-764"
      id="linknoteref-764"><small>764</small></a> to win the handmaid herself?
      In such attempts there is a great risk. This one becomes <i>more</i>
      zealous after an intrigue; that one more tardy; the one procures you as a
      gift for her mistress, the other for her own self. The result is doubtful;
      although she should favour your advances, still it is my advice, to
      refrain from so doing. I shall not go over headlong <i>tracks</i>, and
      over sharp crags; and, under my guidance, no youth shall be deceived. Even
      if she pleases you, while she gives and receives the letters, by her
      person, and not only by her zealousness alone; take care and gain her
      mistress first; let the other follow as her companion; your courtship must
      not be commenced with a servant-maid. This one thing I advise you (if you
      only put some trust in my skill, and if the boisterous wind does not bear
      my words over the seas): either do not attempt, or else do you persist;
      the informer is removed, when once she herself has shared in the
      criminality. The bird does not easily escape when its wings are
      bird-limed; the boar does not readily get away from the loose nets: the
      wounded fish can be held by the hook it has seized. Once tried, press her
      hard, and do not retreat, but as the conqueror. Then, guilty of a fault
      that is common to you both, she will not betray you; and the sayings and
      doings of her mistress will be well known to you. But let this be well
      concealed; if your informant shall be well concealed, your mistress will
      ever be under your eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is mistaken who supposes that time is the object of those only who till
      the fields, and is to be observed by mariners alone. Neither must the corn
      be always trusted to the treacherous soil; nor the hollow ships at all
      times to the green waves; nor is it safe to be ever angling for the
      charming fair. The same thing may often be better done when an opportunity
      offers. Whether it is her birthday <a href="#linknote-765"
      name="linknoteref-765" id="linknoteref-765"><small>765</small></a> that
      comes, or whether the Calends, <a href="#linknote-766"
      name="linknoteref-766" id="linknoteref-766"><small>766</small></a> which
      Venus delights to have as the successor of the month of Mars; or whether
      the Circus shall be adorned, not with statues, as it was before, but shall
      be containing the wealth of kings <a href="#linknote-767"
      name="linknoteref-767" id="linknoteref-767"><small>767</small></a> exposed
      to view; delay your project; then the storm is boisterous, then the
      Pleiades prevail; <a href="#linknote-768" name="linknoteref-768"
      id="linknoteref-768"><small>768</small></a> then, the tender Kid is
      sinking in the ocean wave. Then, 'tis well to desist; then, if one trusts
      the deep, with difficulty he grasps the shipwrecked fragments of his
      dismantled bark. You may make a beginning on the day on which tearful
      Allia <a href="#linknote-769" name="linknoteref-769" id="linknoteref-769"><small>769</small></a>
      was stained with the blood of the Latian wounds; on the day, too, when the
      festival recurs, observed each seventh day by the Syrian of Palestine, a
      day not suited for <a href="#linknote-770" name="linknoteref-770"
      id="linknoteref-770"><small>770</small></a> the transaction of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great must be <a href="#linknote-771" name="linknoteref-771"
      id="linknoteref-771"><small>771</small></a> your dread of the birthday of
      your mistress, and unlucky be that day on which any present must be made.
      Though you should cleverly avoid her, still she will spoil you; a woman
      finds contrivances, by means of which to plunder the riches of the eager
      lover. The loosely-clad pedlar <a href="#linknote-772"
      name="linknoteref-772" id="linknoteref-772"><small>772</small></a> will be
      coming to your mistress, so fond of buying, and while you are by, will be
      exposing his wares. She wills ask you to examine them, only that you may
      appear to be knowing; then she will give you a kiss, and then entreat you
      to purchase. She will swear that she will be content with this for many a
      year; she will say that now she has need of it, now it may be bought a
      bargain. If you shall make the excuse that you have not the money at home
      to give; a promissory note <a href="#linknote-773" name="linknoteref-773"
      id="linknoteref-773"><small>773</small></a> will be asked for; it would
      then profit you not to have learned <a href="#linknote-774"
      name="linknoteref-774" id="linknoteref-774"><small>774</small></a> to
      write. Besides, too; when she asks for a present, as though for the
      birth-day cake, <a href="#linknote-775" name="linknoteref-775"
      id="linknoteref-775"><small>775</small></a> and is born for her own
      pleasure as often as she pleases. And further; when, full of tears, she
      laments her pretended loss, and the jewel <a href="#linknote-776"
      name="linknoteref-776" id="linknoteref-776"><small>776</small></a> is
      feigned to have fallen from her pierced ear. They ask for many a sum to be
      lent them; so lent, they have no inclination to return them. You lose the
      whole; and no thanks are there for your loss. Had I ten mouths, with
      tongues as many, they would not suffice for me to recount the abominable
      contrivances of courtesans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the wax that is poured upon the polished tablets first try the ford;
      let the wax first go as the messenger of your feelings. Let it carry your
      compliments; and whoever you are, add expressions that feign you to be in
      love, and entreaties not a few. Achilles, moved with his entreaties,
      granted Hector to Priam; an angered Divinity is moved by the voice of
      entreaty. Take care to make promises: for what harm is there in promising?
      Any person whatever can be rich in promises. Hope, if she is only once
      cherished, holds out for a long time; she is, indeed, a deceitful Goddess,
      but still a convenient one. Should you give her <a href="#linknote-777"
      name="linknoteref-777" id="linknoteref-777"><small>777</small></a>
      anything, you may for that reason be abandoned by her: she will bear off
      the gift by-gone, and will have lost nothing in return. But that which you
      have not given, you may always seem as though about to give; thus has the
      sterile field full oft deceived its owner. So the gambler, in order that
      he may not lose, does not cease to lose; and the alluring dice ever recall
      the anxious hand. This is the task, this the labour; to gain her without
      even the first present. What she has once given, she will always give,
      that she may not have granted to no purpose. Let the letter go then, and
      let it be couched in tender expressions; and let it ascertain her
      feelings, and be the first to feel its way. A letter borne upon an apple
      <a href="#linknote-778" name="linknoteref-778" id="linknoteref-778"><small>778</small></a>
      deceived Cydippe; and by her own words the fair was unconsciously caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Youths of Rome, learn, I recommend you, the liberal arts; and not only
      that you may defend the trembling accused. Both the public, and the grave
      judge, and the silent Senate, as well as the fair, conquered by your
      eloquence, shall extend their hands. <a href="#linknote-779"
      name="linknoteref-779" id="linknoteref-779"><small>779</small></a> But let
      your power lie concealed: and do not be eloquent at the first. Let your
      letters avoid difficult words. Who, but one bereft of sense, would declaim
      before a charming mistress? Full oft has a letter proved a powerful cause
      for hatred. Let your language be intelligible, and your words the usual
      ones; but pleasing, so that you may seem to be speaking in person. Should
      she not accept your letter, and send it back unread, hope that she will
      read it, and persist in your design. In time the stubborn oxen come
      beneath the ploughs: in time the steeds are taught to submit to the
      flowing reins: by continued use the ring of iron <a href="#linknote-780"
      name="linknoteref-780" id="linknoteref-780"><small>780</small></a> is
      consumed: by being in the ground continually, the crooked plough is worn
      out. What is there harder than stone? What more yielding than water? Yet
      hard stones are hollowed out by yielding water. Only persist, and in time
      you will overcome Penelope herself. You see that Pergamus was taken after
      a long time; still, it was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she reads it, and will not write in answer, do not attempt to compel
      her. Do you only make her to be continually reading your flattering lines.
      What she has been pleased to read, she will be pleased to answer when
      read. <i>All</i> these things will come in their turn, and by degrees.
      Perhaps even, at first, a discouraging letter will come to you; and one
      that entreats you not to wish to molest her. What she entreats you <i>to
      do</i>, she dreads; what she does not entreat you <i>to do, namely</i>, to
      persist, she wishes you <i>to do</i>. Press on; and soon you will be the
      gainer of your desires. In the meantime, if she shall be carried lying
      along upon her couch, do you, as though quite by accident, approach the
      litter of your mistress; and that no one may give a mischievous ear to
      your words, cunningly conceal, them so far as you can in doubtful signs.
      If, with sauntering foot, the spacious Portico is paced by her; here, too,
      do you bestow your leisure in her attendance. And sometimes do you take
      care to go before; sometimes follow behind; and sometimes be in a hurry,
      and sometimes walk leisurely. And be not ashamed to pass from the throng
      under some of the columns, <a href="#linknote-781" name="linknoteref-781"
      id="linknoteref-781"><small>781</small></a> or to walk with her, side by
      side. And let her not be seated long without you in the curving Theatre;
      in her shoulders she will bring something for you to be spectator of. Her
      you may gaze upon, her you may admire; much may you say by your brows,
      much by your gestures. Clap too, when the actor is dancing <a
      href="#linknote-782" name="linknoteref-782" id="linknoteref-782"><small>782</small></a>
      in the part of some damsel; and whatever lover is represented, him
      applaud. Rise when she rises; sit as long as she is seated; employ your
      time at the caprice of your mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let it not please you to curl your hair with the irons: <a
      href="#linknote-783" name="linknoteref-783" id="linknoteref-783"><small>783</small></a>
      and rub not your legs with the rough pumice. <a href="#linknote-784"
      name="linknoteref-784" id="linknoteref-784"><small>784</small></a> Bid
      those do this, <a href="#linknote-785" name="linknoteref-785"
      id="linknoteref-785"><small>785</small></a> in whose Phrygian notes the
      Cybeleian Mother is celebrated by their yells. A neglect of beauty becomes
      men, Theseus bore off the daughter of Minos, though his temples were
      bedecked by no crisping-pin. Phædra loved Hippolytus, <a
      href="#linknote-786" name="linknoteref-786" id="linknoteref-786"><small>786</small></a>
      and he was not finely trimmed. Adonis, habituated to the woods, was the
      care of a Goddess. But let neatness please you; let your body be bronzed
      on the Plain of Mars: <a href="#linknote-787" name="linknoteref-787"
      id="linknoteref-787"><small>787</small></a> let your robe be well-fitting,
      and without a spot. Let your tongue, too, not be clammy; <a
      href="#linknote-788" name="linknoteref-788" id="linknoteref-788"><small>788</small></a>
      your teeth free from yellowness; and let not your foot wallop about,
      losing itself in the shoe down at heel. Let not the cutting shockingly
      disfigure your hair bolt upright; let your locks, let your beard be
      trimmed by a skilful hand. Let your nails, too, not be jagged, and let
      them be without dirt; and let no hairs project from the cavities of your
      nostrils. And let not the breath of your ill-smelling mouth be offensive;
      and let not the husband and the father of the flock <a href="#linknote-789"
      name="linknoteref-789" id="linknoteref-789"><small>789</small></a> offend
      the nostrils. The rest, allow the luxurious fair to do; and any man that
      perchance disgracefully seeks to attract another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lo! Bacchus calls his own Poet: he, too, aids those who love; and he
      encourages the flame with which he burns himself. The Gnossian fair was
      wandering distractedly on the unknown sands, where little Dia is beaten by
      the ocean waves. And, just as she was <i>on awaking</i> from her sleep, <a
      href="#linknote-790" name="linknoteref-790" id="linknoteref-790"><small>790</small></a>
      clothed in a loose tunic, with bare feet, and having her yellow hair
      loose, she was exclaiming to the deaf waves that Theseus was cruel, while
      the piteous shower of tears was moistening her tender cheeks. She
      exclaimed, and at the same moment she wept; but both became her, nor was
      she rendered unsightly by her tears. And now again beating her most
      beauteous bosom with her hands, she cried&mdash;"That perfidious man has
      gone; what will become of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will become of me?" she said; when cymbals resounded over all the
      shore, and tambourines were beaten with frantic hand. She dropped down
      with alarm, and stopped short in her closing words; and no blood was there
      in her lifeless body. See! the Mimallonian females, <a href="#linknote-791"
      name="linknoteref-791" id="linknoteref-791"><small>791</small></a> with
      their locks flowing on their backs; see! the nimble Satyrs, the throng
      preceding the God; sec! Silenus, the drunken old man, <a
      href="#linknote-792" name="linknoteref-792" id="linknoteref-792"><small>792</small></a>
      on his bending ass, sits there with difficulty, and holds fast by the mane
      that he presses. While he follows the Bacchanals, the Bacchanals both fly
      and return: while the unskilful rider is goading on his animal with his
      stick, slipping from the long-eared ass, he tumbles upon his head. The
      Satyrs cry aloud, "Come, rise up; rise, father!" Now, the God, from his
      chariot, the top of which he had wreathed with grapes, loosened the golden
      reins for the tigers yoked to it. Both her complexion, and Theseus, and
      her voice forsook the fair one; and thrice she attempted flight, and
      thrice was she detained by fear. She shuddered, just as the barren ears of
      corn, which the wind shakes; just as the slender reed quivers in the
      swampy marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her the Divinity said, "Lo! I come to thee a more constant lover;
      damsel of Gnossus, lay aside thy fear, the wife of Bacchus shalt thou be.
      Receive heaven as my gift: a conspicuous Constellation in the heavens,
      full oft, Cretan Diadem, <a href="#linknote-793" name="linknoteref-793"
      id="linknoteref-793"><small>793</small></a> shalt thou direct the veering
      bark." Thus he said; and he leapt from the chariot, that she might not be
      in dread of the tigers; the sand yielded to his foot placed upon it. And
      folding her in his bosom he bore her off; for to struggle she was unable:
      how easy 'tis for a God to be able to do anything. Some sing "Hymenæus,"
      some cry "Evie, Evoë!" <a href="#linknote-794" name="linknoteref-794"
      id="linknoteref-794"><small>794</small></a> Thus are the God and his bride
      united in holy wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, when the gifts of Bacchus placed before you fall to your lot,
      and the fair one shall be a sharer in the convivial couch; pray both to
      father Nyctelius, and his nocturnal rites, that they will bid the wine not
      to take effect on your head. Here, in secret discourse, you may say to her
      many a free word, which she may understand is addressed to her; and you
      may trace out short compliments with a little wine, so that she may read
      on the table <a href="#linknote-795" name="linknoteref-795"
      id="linknoteref-795"><small>795</small></a> that she is your favorite; and
      look on her eyes with eyes that confess your flame; the silent features
      often have both words and expression. Take care to be the next to seize
      the cup that has been touched by her lips; and drink from the side <a
      href="#linknote-796" name="linknoteref-796" id="linknoteref-796"><small>796</small></a>
      that the fair drinks from. And whatever food she shall have touched with
      her fingers, <a href="#linknote-797" name="linknoteref-797"
      id="linknoteref-797"><small>797</small></a> do you reach for it; and while
      you are reaching, her hand may be touched by you. Let it also be your
      object to please the husband of the fair; <i>once</i> made a friend, he
      will be more serviceable for your designs. If you are drinking by lot, <a
      href="#linknote-798" name="linknoteref-798" id="linknoteref-798"><small>798</small></a>
      grant him the first turn: let the chaplet, taken from your own head, be
      presented to him. Whether he is below you, or whether your neighbour, let
      him help Himself to every thing first; and do not hesitate to speak only
      after he has spoken. Secure and much frequented is the path, for deceiving
      through the name of friendship. Secure and much frequented though that
      path be; <i>still</i> it is to be condemned. For this cause 'tis that the
      agent attends even too much <a href="#linknote-799" name="linknoteref-799"
      id="linknoteref-799"><small>799</small></a> to his agency, and thinks that
      more things ought to be looked after by him than those entrusted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sure rule for drinking shall be given you by me: let both your mind and
      your feet ever observe their duty. Especially avoid quarrels stimulated by
      wine, and hands too ready for savage warfare. Eurytion <a
      href="#linknote-801" name="linknoteref-801" id="linknoteref-801"><small>801</small></a>
      met his death from foolishly quaffing the wine set before him. Banquets
      and wine are rather suited for pleasant mirth. If you have a voice, sing;
      if pliant arms, dance; and by whatever talent you can amuse, amuse. As
      real drunkenness offends, so feigned <i>inebriety</i> will prove of
      service. Let your deceiving tongue stutter with lisping accents; so that
      whatever you shall do or say with more freedom than usual, it may be
      supposed that excess of wine is the cause. And express all good wishes for
      your mistress; all good wishes for him who shares her couch; but in your
      silent thoughts pray for curses on her husband. But when, the tables
      removed, the guests shall be going, (the very crowd will afford you access
      and room) mix in the throng: and quietly stealing up <a
      href="#linknote-802" name="linknoteref-802" id="linknoteref-802"><small>802</small></a>
      to her as she walks, twitch her side with your fingers; and touch her foot
      with your foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now is the time come for some conversation: fly afar hence, coy
      bashfulness, let Chance and Venus befriend the daring. Let your eloquence
      not be subject to any laws of mine; only make a beginning, of your own
      accord you will prove fluent. You must act the lover, and wounds must be
      feigned in your words. Hence let confidence be sought by you, by means of
      any contrivances whatever. And 'tis no hard matter to be believed; each
      woman seems to herself worthy to be loved. Though she be ugly in the
      extreme, to no one are her own looks displeasing. Yet often, he that
      pretends to love, begins in reality: full oft he becomes that which in the
      beginning he feigned to be. For this cause, the rather, O ye fair, be
      propitious to those who pretend. That passion will become real, which so
      lately was feigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now be it your part stealthily to captivate her affection by attentions;
      just as the shelving bank is encroached on by the flowing stream. Be not
      tired of praising either her face or her hair; her taper fingers too, and
      her small foot. The praise of their beauty pleases even the chaste; their
      charms are the care and the pleasure of even maidens. For, why, even now,
      are Juno and Pallas ashamed at not having gained the decision in the
      Phrygian groves? The bird of Juno <a href="#linknote-803"
      name="linknoteref-803" id="linknoteref-803"><small>803</small></a> exposes
      her feathers, when praised; if you look at them in silence, she conceals
      her treasures. Amid the contests of the rapid course, their trimmed manes,
      and their patted necks, delight the steeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Promise, too, without hesitation: promises attract the fair: make any Gods
      you please to be witnesses of what you promise. Jupiter, from on high,
      smiles at the perjuries of lovers, and commands the Æolian South winds to
      sweep them away as worthless, Jupiter was accustomed to swear falsely to
      Juno by the Styx: now is he himself indulgent to his own precedent. 'Tis
      expedient that there should be Gods; <a href="#linknote-804"
      name="linknoteref-804" id="linknoteref-804"><small>804</small></a> and as
      it is expedient, let us believe them to exist. Let frankincense and wine
      be presented on their ancient altars. No repose, free from care and
      similar to sleep, possesses them; live in innocence, for a Divinity is
      ever present. Restore the pledge; let piety observe her duties; be there
      no fraud; keep your hands free from bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deceive, if you are wise, the fair alone with Impunity; for this one piece
      of deceit only is good faith to be disregarded. Deceive the deceivers; in
      a great measure they are all a guilty race; let them fall into the toils
      which they have spread. Egypt is said to have been without showers that
      refresh the fields: and to have been parched during nine years. When
      Thrasius went to Busiris, <a href="#linknote-805" name="linknoteref-805"
      id="linknoteref-805"><small>805</small></a> and showed that Jupiter could
      be propitiated by shedding the blood of strangers; to him Busiris said,
      "Thou shalt become the first sacrifice to Jove, and, a stranger, thou
      shalt produce rain for Egypt." Phalaris, too, burnt in the bull the limbs
      of the cruel Perillus; the unhappy inventor was the first to make proof of
      his work. Each of them was just; and, indeed, no law is there more
      righteous, than that the contrivers of death should perish by their own
      contrivances. Therefore, since perjuries with justice impose upon the
      perjured, let woman grieve, deceived through a precedent her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears, too, are of utility: by tears you will move adamant. Make her, if
      you can, to see your moistened cheeks. If tears shall fail you, for indeed
      they do not always come in time, touch your eyes with your wet hand. What
      discreet person would not mingle kisses with tender words? Though she
      should not grant them; still take them ungranted. Perhaps she will
      struggle at first, and will say, "You naughty man!" still, in her
      struggling, she will wish to be overcome. Only, let them not, rudely
      snatched, hurt her tender lips, and take care that she may not be able to
      complain that they have proved a cause of pain. He who has gained kisses,
      if he cannot gain the rest as well, will deserve to lose even that which
      has been granted him. How much is there wanting for unlimited enjoyment
      after a kiss! Oh shocking! 'twere <i>downright</i> clownishness, and not
      modesty. Call it violence, if you like; such violence is pleasing to the
      fair; they often wish, through compulsion, to grant what they are
      delighted <i>to grant</i>. Whatever fair one has been despoiled by the
      sudden violence of passion, she is delighted at it; and the chief is as
      good as a godsend. But she, who, when she might have been carried by
      storm, has escaped untouched, though, in her features, she should pretend
      gladness, will <i>really</i> be sorry. Phoebe suffered <a
      href="#linknote-806" name="linknoteref-806" id="linknoteref-806"><small>806</small></a>
      violence; to her sister was violence offered; and pleasing was either
      ravisher to the ravished. The damsel of Scyros being united to the
      Hæmonian hero, is a well-known story indeed, but not unworthy to be
      related.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Goddess, worthy to conquer the other two at the foot of mount
      Ida, had given her reward of the approval of her beauty. Now, from a
      distant region, had a daughter-in-law come to Priam: and within Ilian
      walls there was a Grecian wife. All swore in the words of the affronted
      husband; for the grief of one was the common cause. A disgraceful thing,
      had he not yielded in this to the entreaties of his mother, Achilles had
      concealed his manhood by the long garments. What art thou doing,
      descendant of Æacus? The wool is no task of thine. Do thou seek glory by
      other arts of Pallas. What hast thou to do with work-baskets? <a
      href="#linknote-807" name="linknoteref-807" id="linknoteref-807"><small>807</small></a>
      Thy hand is fitted for holding the shield. Why hold the allotted flax in
      thy right hand, by which Hector shall fall? Spurn those spindles enwrapped
      in the laborious warp; the lance from Pelion is to be brandished by that
      hand. By chance in the same chamber there was a royal maiden; in her own
      undoing she found that he was a male. By force, indeed, was she overcome,
      so we must believe: but still, by force was she willing to be overcome.
      Many a time did she say, "Stay," when now Achilles was hastening <i>to
      depart</i>; for, the distaff laid aside, he had assumed valiant arms.
      Where now is this violence? Why, with gentle voice, Deidamia, dost thou
      detain the perpetrator of thy disgrace? As, forsooth, there is shame in
      first beginning at any time, so 'tis pleasing <i>to the fair</i> to
      submit, when the other takes the initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! too great is the confidence of any youth in his own good looks, if
      he awaits for her to be the first to ask him. Let the man make the first
      approaches; let the man use words of entreaty; she will kindly receive his
      soft entreaties. To gain <i>your wish</i>, ask; <i>she only wishes to be
      asked</i>. Tell her the cause and the origin of your desires. Jupiter came
      as a suppliant to the Heroines of olden times; <a href="#linknote-808"
      name="linknoteref-808" id="linknoteref-808"><small>808</small></a> no fair
      one found fault with great Jove. But if you perceive puffed-up vanity to
      be the result of your prayers, desist from your design, and withhold your
      advances. Many desire that which flies from them, and hate that which is
      close at hand. By pressing on less eagerly, remove all weariness of
      yourself. Nor must your hope of enjoyment be always confessed by you as
      you entreat; let Love make his entrance concealed beneath the name of
      friendship. By this introduction, I have seen the prudish fair deceived;
      he who was the friend, became the lover. A fair complexion is unbecoming
      in a sailor; he ought to be swarthy, from the spray of the sea and the
      rays of the sun. It is unbecoming, too, to the husbandman, who, with his
      crooked plough and his heavy harrows, is always turning up the ground in
      the open air. And if your body is fair, you, by whom the glory of the
      chaplet of Pallas <a href="#linknote-809" name="linknoteref-809"
      id="linknoteref-809"><small>809</small></a> is sought, you will be
      unsightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let every one that is in love be pale; that is the proper complexion for
      one in love. That is becoming; from your features, let the fair think that
      you are not in good health. Pale with love for Lyrice, <a
      href="#linknote-810" name="linknoteref-810" id="linknoteref-810"><small>810</small></a>
      did Orion wander in the woods; pale for the Naiad, in her indifference,
      was Daphnis. <a href="#linknote-811" name="linknoteref-811"
      id="linknoteref-811"><small>811</small></a> Thinness, too, shows the
      feelings; and think it no disgrace to put a hood over your shining looks.
      Let sleepless nights attenuate the bodies of the youths; care, too, and
      the grief that proceeds from violent love. That you may gain your desires,
      be wretched, that he who sees you may be able to say, "You are in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall I complain, or <i>only</i> remind you how all right and wrong is
      confused? Friendship is but a name, constancy an empty title. Alas! alas!
      it is not safe to praise the object that you love to your friend. When he
      has credited your praises, he supplants you. But the descendant of Actor
      did not defile the couch of Achilles; so far as Pirithous was concerned,
      Phædra was chaste. Pylades <a href="#linknote-812" name="linknoteref-812"
      id="linknoteref-812"><small>812</small></a> loved Hermione, with the
      affection with which Phoebus loved Pallas; and he was such, daughter of
      Tyndarus, as thy twin brother Castor was towards thee. If any one expects
      the same, let him expect that the tamarisks will bear apples, and let him
      look for honey in the middle of the stream. Nothing pleases but what is
      base; his own gratification is the object of each. This, too, becomes
      pleasant from the sorrow of another. Oh disgraceful conduct! no enemy is
      to be dreaded by the lover. Shun those whom you think trustworthy; then
      you will be safe. Shun your kinsman, and your brother, and your dear
      friend; this class will cause you real alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was <i>here</i> about to conclude; but there are various dispositions in
      the fair; treat these thousand dispositions in a thousand <i>different</i>
      ways. The same soil does not produce everything; one suits the vine,
      another the olive; in this, corn springs up vigorously. There are as many
      characters in these various dispositions, as there are forms in the world;
      the man that is wise, will adapt himself to these innumerable characters.
      And as at one moment Proteus will make himself flow in running water; and
      now will be a lion, now a tree, now a shaggy goat. These fish are taken
      with a dart, <a href="#linknote-813" name="linknoteref-813"
      id="linknoteref-813"><small>813</small></a> those with hooks; these the
      encircling nets draw up, the rope being extended. And let no one method be
      adopted by you for all years. The aged hind will espy from a greater
      distance your contrivances. Should you seem learned to the ignorant, or
      forward to the bashful, she will at once distrust herself, now
      apprehensive. Thence it happens, that she who has dreaded to trust herself
      to the well-bred man, <i>often</i> falls into the embrace of some
      worthless inferior.

    <p>
      A part remains of the task which I have undertaken, a part is completed;

      Such did the stranger son of Priam set his whitening sails from the armed
      Amyclæ, <a href="#linknote-902" name="linknoteref-902" id="linknoteref-902"><small>902</small></a>
      together with the ravished wife. Such was he who bore thee, Hippodamia, in
      his victorious chariot, carried by the wheels of the stranger. Why hasten
      then, young man? Thy ship is sailing in the midst of the waves; and far
      distant is the harbour for which I make. It is not enough, me your Poet,
      for the fair to be gained by you. Through my skill has she been acquired;
      through my skill must she be retained. 'Tis no less merit to keep what is
      acquired, than to gain it. In the former there is some chance; in the
      latter will be a work of art.

    <p>
      Now, if ever, Boy <i>Cupid</i> and Cytherea, be propitious <i>to me</i>:
      now, Erato; <a href="#linknote-903" name="linknoteref-903"
      id="linknoteref-903"><small>903</small></a> for thou hast a name from
      Love. Great attempts do I contemplate; to tell by what means Love can be
      arrested, the Boy that wanders over the world so wide. He is both
      inconstant, and he has two wings with which to fly.'Tis an arduous task to
      impose laws on these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minos had obstructed all means of escape to the stranger. He discovered a
      bold path <a href="#linknote-904" name="linknoteref-904"
      id="linknoteref-904"><small>904</small></a> with his wings. When Dædalus
      had enclosed the man half-bull, and the bull half-man, that was conceived
      in the criminality of his mother; he said, "Most just Minos, let there be
      a termination of my exile; and let my paternal land receive my ashes. And
      since, harassed by the cruel Destinies, I cannot live in my country, let
      me be enabled to die. If the merits of an old man are but small, grant a
      return to this boy; if thou art unwilling to favour the boy, then favour
      the old man." This he said: but both this and many more things he might
      have said; the other did not permit a return to the hero. Soon as he saw
      this, he said, "Now, O now, Dædalus, thou hast a subject, upon which thou
      mayst prove ingenious. Lo! Minos possesses the land, and he possesses the
      ocean; neither earth nor water is open for our escape; there remains a
      path through the heavens; through the heavens will we attempt to go.
      Jupiter on high, grant pardon to my design. I do not aim to reach the
      starry abodes; there is no way but this one, by which I may escape the
      tyrant. Should a road through Styx be granted; then we will swim through
      the Stygian waves; let the laws of nature be changed by me." <i>Misfortunes
      often sharpen the genius</i>; who could have ever believed, that a mortal
      could attempt the paths of the air?
    </p>
    <p>
      He arranges swift feathers in order, like oars, <a href="#linknote-905"
      name="linknoteref-905" id="linknoteref-905"><small>905</small></a> and
      connects the light work with fastenings of thread; the lower part, too, is
      bound together with wax, melted by the fire; and now the work of the new
      contrivance is finished. The smiling boy handles both the wax and the
      feathers, not knowing that these instruments are prepared for his own
      shoulders. To him his father says: "With these ships must we reach our
      native land; by these means must we escape from Minos. The air Minos could
      not, all else he has, shut against us. Cleave the air, which still thou
      mayst, with these my inventions. But neither the virgin of Tegeæa, nor the
      sword-bearing Orion, <a href="#linknote-906" name="linknoteref-906"
      id="linknoteref-906"><small>906</small></a> the companion of Bootes, will
      have to be beheld by thee. Follow me with the wings given to thee: I will
      go before on the way. Be it thy care to follow; me thy leader, thou wilt
      he safe. But if we shall go through the air of the heavens, the sun close
      to us, the wax will not be able to endure the heat. If we shall wave our
      wings below, the sea near to us, the fluttering feathers will be wet with
      the ocean spray. Fly between them both; dread, too, the winds, my son; and
      whichever way the breezes shall blow, set thy prospering sails."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he thus advises; he fits his work on to the boy, and shows how it is
      to be moved; just as their mother teaches the helpless birds. Then he
      places upon his shoulders the wings made for himself; and with timidity he
      poises his body along this new track. And now about to fly, he gives
      kisses to his little son; and the cheeks of the father do not withhold
      their tears. There is a hill, less than a mountain, more lofty than the
      level plain; hence are their two bodies entrusted to their mournful
      flight. Dædalus both moves his own wings himself, and looks back on those
      of his son; and he ever keeps on his own course. And now this unusual path
      delights him, and, fear laid aside, Icarus flies more courageously with
      emboldened skill. A person sees them, while he is angling <a
      href="#linknote-907" name="linknoteref-907" id="linknoteref-907"><small>907</small></a>
      for fish with his quivering rod, and his right hand desists from the work
      he has commenced. Now Samos and Naxos had been left behind, on the left
      hand, and Paros, and Delos beloved by the Clarian God. <a
      href="#linknote-908" name="linknoteref-908" id="linknoteref-908"><small>908</small></a>
      Lebynthos was to the right, and Calymne <a href="#linknote-909"
      name="linknoteref-909" id="linknoteref-909"><small>909</small></a> shaded
      with its woods, and Astypalæa, <a href="#linknote-910"
      name="linknoteref-910" id="linknoteref-910"><small>910</small></a>
      surrounded with its fishy shallows; when the boy, too venturesome in his
      inconsiderate daring, took a higher flight, and forsook his guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fastenings give way; and the wax melts, the Divinity being so near;
      and his arms, when moved, no longer catch the light breeze. Alarmed, he
      looks down upon the sea from the lofty heavens; darkness, arising from
      trembling apprehension, comes over his eyes. The wax has now melted; he
      waves his bare arms, and he trembles, and has no means whereby to be
      supported. Downward he falls; and as he falls, he cries, "Father! O
      father! I am undone!" As he spoke, the azure waves closed his mouth. But
      the unhappy father, a father now no longer, cried aloud, "Icarus, where
      art thou? Or under what part of the sky dost thou fly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Icarus," again he cried aloud; his feathers he beheld in the waves. The
      dry land covers his bones; the sea retains his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minos could not restrain the wings of a mortal; I myself am attempting to
      arrest a winged Divinity. If any one has recourse to the Hæmonian arts,
      and gives that which he has torn from the forehead of the young horse, <a
      href="#linknote-911" name="linknoteref-911" id="linknoteref-911"><small>911</small></a>
      he is mistaken. The herbs of Medea will not cause love to endure; nor yet
      the Marsian spells <a href="#linknote-912" name="linknoteref-912"
      id="linknoteref-912"><small>912</small></a> mingled with the magic notes.
      The Phasian damsel would have retained the son of Æson, Circe Ulysses, if
      love could only have been preserved through incantations. Philtres, too,
      causing paleness, <a href="#linknote-913" name="linknoteref-913"
      id="linknoteref-913"><small>913</small></a> are of no use when
      administered to the fair. Philtres injure the intellect, and have a
      maddening effect. Afar be all criminal attempts; to be loved, be worthy to
      be loved; <i>a property</i> which comeliness, or beauty alone, will not
      confer upon you. Though you should be Nireus, <a href="#linknote-914"
      name="linknoteref-914" id="linknoteref-914"><small>914</small></a> be
      praised by ancient Homer, and the charming Hylas, <a href="#linknote-915"
      name="linknoteref-915" id="linknoteref-915"><small>915</small></a> carried
      off by the criminality of the Naiads; that you may retain your mistress,
      and not have to wonder that you are deserted, add the endowments of the
      mind to the advantages of the person. Beauty is a fleeting advantage; and
      the more it increases in years, the less it becomes, and, itself, is
      consumed by length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the violets nor the opening lilies bloom for ever; and, the roses
      lost, the thorny bush is prickly left behind. And, handsome man, soon
      shall come to you the hoary locks; soon shall come the wrinkles, to furrow
      your body over. Now form a disposition which may be lasting, and add it to
      your beauty; that alone endures to the closing pile. And be it no light
      care to cultivate the mind with the liberal arts, and to learn thoroughly
      the two languages, <i>the Latin and the Greek</i>. Ulysses was not
      handsome, but he was fluent; and yet with love he racked the ocean
      Goddesses. <a href="#linknote-916" name="linknoteref-916"
      id="linknoteref-916"><small>916</small></a> Ah! how oft did Calypso grieve
      at his hastening to depart, and declare that the waves were not favorable
      to his oars! Again and again did she enquire into the catastrophe of Troy.
      Often in another manner was he wont to repeat the same thing. On the shore
      they were standing; even there did the beauteous Calypso enquire about the
      blood-stained death of the Odrysian chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a little stick, for by chance he was holding a stick, he depicted on
      the firm shore the subject on which she was enquiring. "This is Troy,"
      said he; and the walls he drew on the shore; "This must be Simois for
      thee, and suppose these to be my tents. There was a plain," and here he
      drew the plain, "which we moistened with the blood of Dolon, <a
      href="#linknote-917" name="linknoteref-917" id="linknoteref-917"><small>917</small></a>
      while, as a spy, he was longing for the Hæmonian horses. <a
      href="#linknote-918" name="linknoteref-918" id="linknoteref-918"><small>918</small></a>
      There were the tents of the Sithonian Rhesus; in this direction was I
      borne back again by the captured steeds." And many other things was he
      depicting, when the waves suddenly carried off both Pergamus and the tents
      of Rhesus together with their chief. Then the Goddess said, "Dost thou
      behold how famous names these waves have swept away, which thou dost trust
      will be favorable to thee about to depart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Come then, with hesitation, feel confidence in beauty so deceiving,
      whoever you are; or else possess something of more value than comeliness.
      A beseeming courtesy especially enlists the feelings; rudeness and harsh
      language promote hatred. We dislike the hawk, because it is always living
      in warfare; the wolves too, that are wont to rush upon the startled
      flocks. But the swallow, because it is gentle, is exempt from the snares
      of men; and the Chaonian bird <a href="#linknote-919"
      name="linknoteref-919" id="linknoteref-919"><small>919</small></a> has the
      turrets for it to inhabit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afar lie all strife and contentions of the abusive tongue; with sweet
      words must gentle love be cherished. With strife let both wives persecute
      their husbands, and husbands their wives; and, each in their turn, let
      them ever be thinking that they must resort to law. <a href="#linknote-920"
      name="linknoteref-920" id="linknoteref-920"><small>920</small></a> This is
      the part of wives; strife is the dowry of the wife. Let the mistress ever
      hear the accents that she longs for. At the bidding of no law have you
      come to live together; in your case 'tis love that performs the duties of
      the law. Bring soft caresses, and words that delight the ear, that she may
      <i>ever</i> be joyous at your approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not come as the instructor of the wealthy in Love; he who makes
      presents has no need of my experience. He who says, whenever he pleases,
      "Accept this," has a genius of his own. To him do I yield: he has greater
      attractions than have any discoveries of mine. I am the instructor of the
      poor, because, as a poor man, I have been in love. When I could not give
      presents, I gave verses. <a href="#linknote-921" name="linknoteref-921"
      id="linknoteref-921"><small>921</small></a> Let the poor man love with
      caution, let the poor man stand in fear of bad language, and let him <i>put
      up with many a thing, not to be endured by the rich</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that once, when in a rage, I disarranged the hair of my
      mistress; of how many a day did that anger deprive me! I do not think I
      did, and I did not see that I had, torn her tunic, but she said so, and at
      my cost it was replaced. But you who are wise, avoid the errors of your
      instructor; and stand in awe of the punishment of my transgressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let battles be with the Parthians, but be there peace with your refined
      mistress; mirth too, and whatever besides contains a reason for love. If
      she is not sufficiently kind or affable to you her lover; have patience,
      and bear it; after a time she will be softened. By giving way the supple
      branch is bent from the tree; if you make trial of your strength, you
      break it. By giving way the waves are swam across; but you cannot overcome
      the stream if you swim <i>against the flood</i> which the tide carries
      down. 'Tis yielding that subdues the tigers and the Numidian lions. By
      degrees only does the bull submit to the rustic plough. What was there
      more coy than Atalanta of Nonacris? <a href="#linknote-922"
      name="linknoteref-922" id="linknoteref-922"><small>922</small></a> Yet,
      untamed as she was, she yielded to the deserving qualities of a man. They
      say that many a time, beneath the trees, Milanion wept at his mishaps, and
      the unkind conduct of the fair one. Full oft on his neck, as ordered, did
      he bear the treacherous toils; full oft with his cruel spear did he
      transfix the savage boars. Wounded, too, he experienced the stretched bow
      of Hylæus; <a href="#linknote-923" name="linknoteref-923"
      id="linknoteref-923"><small>923</small></a> but yet there was another bow
      still more felt than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not bid you, in arms, to climb the woods of Mænalus, and I do not bid
      you to carry the toils upon your neck. Nor yet do I bid you to expose your
      breast to the discharged arrows. The requirements of my skill will be but
      light to the careful man. Yield to her when opposing; by yielding, you
      will come off victorious. Only take care to perform the part which she
      shall bid you. What she blames, do you blame; whatever she approves, do
      you approve; what she says, do you say; what she denies, do you deny. Does
      she smile, do you smile; if she weeps, do you remember to weep. Let her
      prescribe the law for the regulation of your features. If she plays, and
      throws the ivory cubes <a href="#linknote-924" name="linknoteref-924"
      id="linknoteref-924"><small>924</small></a> with her hand, do you throw
      unsuccessfully, do you make bad moves <a href="#linknote-925"
      name="linknoteref-925" id="linknoteref-925"><small>925</small></a> to the
      throws; or if you are throwing <a href="#linknote-926"
      name="linknoteref-926" id="linknoteref-926"><small>926</small></a> the
      dice, let not the penalty attend upon her losing; take care that losing
      throws often befall yourself, if your piece is moving at the game that
      imitates <a href="#linknote-927" name="linknoteref-927"
      id="linknoteref-927"><small>927</small></a> the tactics of war, take care
      that your man falls before his enemy of glass. Do you yourself hold the
      screen <a href="#linknote-928" name="linknoteref-928" id="linknoteref-928"><small>928</small></a>
      stretched out by its ribs; do you make room in the crowd the way that she
      is going. And do not delay to place the footstool before the tasteful,
      couch; <a href="#linknote-929" name="linknoteref-929" id="linknoteref-929"><small>929</small></a>
      and take off or put on the sandals for her delicate feet. Often, too, must
      the hand of your mistress, when cold, be made warm in your bosom, though
      you yourself should shiver in consequence. And think it no disgrace
      (although it should be a disgrace to you, still it will give pleasure), to
      hold the looking-glass <a href="#linknote-930" name="linknoteref-930"
      id="linknoteref-930"><small>930</small></a> with the hand of a free-born
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who, by killing the monsters of his wearied step-mother, earned those
      heavens which before he had supported, is believed, amid the Ionian girls,
      to have held the work-basket, <a href="#linknote-931"
      name="linknoteref-931" id="linknoteref-931"><small>931</small></a> and to
      have wrought the rough wool. The Tirynthian hero was obedient to the
      commands of his mistress. Go then, and hesitate to endure what he
      submitted to. When bidden to come to the Forum, take care always to be
      there before the appointed time; and do not go away until a late hour.
      Does she appoint to meet you at any place; put off everything else: run
      quickly, and let not the crowd stop your purposed route. Is she returning
      home at night, after having been at a feast; then, too, if she calls, come
      to her as though a servant. <a href="#linknote-932" name="linknoteref-932"
      id="linknoteref-932"><small>932</small></a> If you are in the country and
      she says, "Come," (love hates the tardy) if a vehicle <a
      href="#linknote-933" name="linknoteref-933" id="linknoteref-933"><small>933</small></a>
      is not at hand, go your journey on foot. Let neither bad weather nor the
      parching Dog-star detain you, nor the road made white with the snow that
      lies there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love is a kind of warfare; cowards, avaunt! These are not the standards to
      be defended by timid men. In this tender warfare, night, and wintry
      storms, and long journies, and cruel pain, and every kind of toil, have
      their part. Many a time will you have to endure the rain pouring from the
      clouds of heaven; cold and on the bare ground full oft will you lie.
      Cynthius <a href="#linknote-934" name="linknoteref-934"
      id="linknoteref-934"><small>934</small></a> said to have fed the cows of
      Admetus of Pheræ, and to have lived in an humble cottage. What was
      becoming to Phoebus, to whom is it not becoming? Away with all conceit,
      whoever you are, who have a care for a lasting passion. If access is
      denied you by a safe and smooth path; and if her door shall be fastened by
      the bar put up; then, do you slip straight down through the open roof <a
      href="#linknote-935" name="linknoteref-935" id="linknoteref-935"><small>935</small></a>
      let the high window, <a href="#linknote-936" name="linknoteref-936"
      id="linknoteref-936"><small>936</small></a> too, present a secret passage.
      She will be pleased when she knows that she has proved the cause of risk
      to you. This will be to your mistress a pledge of your unvarying love.
      Full oft, Leander, couldst thou have done without thy mistress; that she
      might know thy passion, thou didst swim across.
    </p>
    <p>
      And be not ashamed to make her handmaids, as each one is superior in rank,
      nor yet her male servants, entirely your own. Salute them each by name,
      there will be nothing thrown away: press their humble hands, proud lover,
      with your own. Moreover, (the expense is but trifling) give to the servant
      who asks, some little present from your means. Make a present, too, to the
      handmaid, on the day on which <a href="#linknote-937"
      name="linknoteref-937" id="linknoteref-937"><small>937</small></a> the
      Gallic army, deceived by the garments of the matrons, received
      retribution. Follow my advice, and make the lower classes <a
      href="#linknote-938" name="linknoteref-938" id="linknoteref-938"><small>938</small></a>
      your own; in that number let there always be the porter, and him who lies
      before the door of her chamber. And I do not bid you present to your
      mistress any costly gift; give her moderate ones, but, in your
      discrimination, well selected from those that are moderate. While the
      country is abundantly rich in produce, while the branches are bending
      beneath their load, let the boy bring your gifts from the country in his
      basket. You may say that they have been sent by you from your suburban
      retreat, although they may have been bought even in the Sacred Street. <a
      href="#linknote-939" name="linknoteref-939" id="linknoteref-939"><small>939</small></a>
      Let him carry either grapes, or what Amaryllis was so fond of; <a
      href="#linknote-940" name="linknoteref-940" id="linknoteref-940"><small>940</small></a>
      but, at the present day, she is fond of chesnuts no longer. And, besides,
      both with a thrush and a pigeon, <a href="#linknote-941"
      name="linknoteref-941" id="linknoteref-941"><small>941</small></a> sent as
      a present, you may show how attentive you are to your mistress. By these
      means <a href="#linknote-942" name="linknoteref-942" id="linknoteref-942"><small>942</small></a>
      are the expectations of death, and solitary old age, disgracefully made
      matter of purchase. Oh! may they perish through whom gifts promote
      criminal objects!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should I recommend you to send tender lines as well? Alas! poetry does
      not <a href="#linknote-943" name="linknoteref-943" id="linknoteref-943"><small>943</small></a>
      gain much honour. Verses are praised: but 'tis costly gifts that are
      sought. If he is only rich, <a href="#linknote-944" name="linknoteref-944"
      id="linknoteref-944"><small>944</small></a> a very barbarian is pleasing.
      Truly is this the golden age; the greatest honours accrue through gold;
      love is purchased with gold. Though thou thyself, Homer, shouldst come,
      attended by the Muses; if thou shouldst bring nothing with thee, thou
      wouldst be turned out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet there are the learned fair, a very limited number; another set are
      not learned, but they wish to be so. Both kinds may be praised in verse;
      the reader may set off the lines of whatever quality by a melodious voice.
      Indeed, a poem, carefully composed in their honour, will be to these or to
      those, as good, perhaps, as a little present. But take care that whatever
      you are about to do of your own accord and consider convenient, your
      mistress shall always first ask that of you. Has freedom been promised to
      any one of your slaves; still cause him to make a request for it of your
      mistress. If you forgive punishment and cruel fetters to your slave, let
      her be indebted to you for what you were about to do. Let the advantage be
      your own; let the credit be given to your mistress. Suffer no loss
      yourself, and let her act the part of the person in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whosoever you are who have a care to retain the fair, cause her to
      believe that you are enchanted with her beauty. If she is in Tyrian
      costume, praise the dress of Tyrian hue; <a href="#linknote-945"
      name="linknoteref-945" id="linknoteref-945"><small>945</small></a> if she
      is in that of Cos, <a href="#linknote-946" name="linknoteref-946"
      id="linknoteref-946"><small>946</small></a> consider the Coan habit as
      becoming. Is she arrayed in gold, let her be more precious in your eyes
      than gold itself: if she wears a dress of felt, <a href="#linknote-947"
      name="linknoteref-947" id="linknoteref-947"><small>947</small></a> praise
      the felt dress that she wears. Does she stand before you in her tunic,
      exclaim, "You are setting me on fire;" <a href="#linknote-948"
      name="linknoteref-948" id="linknoteref-948"><small>948</small></a> but
      entreat her, with a voice of anxiety, to beware of the cold. Is the
      parting of her hair nicely arranged; praise the parting of it; has she
      curled her hair by aid of the fire: curled locks, do you prove the
      attraction. As she dances, admire her arms, her voice as she sings; and
      use the words of one complaining because she has left off. Her very
      embraces <a href="#linknote-949" name="linknoteref-949"
      id="linknoteref-949"><small>949</small></a> you may commend, on the points
      that please yourself; and with murmuring accents you may signify your
      delight. Though she be more fierce than the grim Medusa; to her lover she
      will become gentle and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, take you care that you be not discovered to be a deceiver in these
      expressions; and by your looks do not contradict your words. If devices
      are concealed, they are of use; when discovered, they cause shame, and
      deservedly remove confidence for all future time. Often, at the approach
      of autumn (when the year is most beauteous, and the filled grape is
      growing red with its purple juice; at the time when at one moment we are
      chilled with cold, at another we are melted with heat), through the
      varying temperature a languor takes possession of the body. She, indeed,
      may be in good health; but if, through illness she keeps her bed, and,
      ailing, feels the bad effects of the weather, then let your love and
      affection be proved to the fair; then sow, that hereafter with the sickle
      of abundance you may reap. Let no disgust at her malady, that renders her
      so cross, come upon you: by your hands too, let whatever she will permit,
      be done. And let her see you as you weep; and be not tired of giving her
      kisses; and with her parched lips let her dry up your tears. Make many a
      vow for her cure, but all before her: and as often as she will permit, be
      seeing pleasant visions to tell her of. Let the old woman come, <a
      href="#linknote-950" name="linknoteref-950" id="linknoteref-950"><small>950</small></a>
      too, to purify her couch and chamber; and in her palsied hand let her
      carry before her the sulphur and the eggs. In all these things there will
      be traces of a pleasing attention; for many a one has this road proved a
      path to another man's will. But still, let not loathing on the part of the
      sick fair be the result of your officiousness; let there be certain limits
      shown in your careful attentiveness. Do not you forbid her food, nor
      administer the cups with the bitter draught; let your rival mingle those.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when you have gained the open sea, you must not use the breeze to
      which you set your sails from off the shore. While Love is wandering in
      his youth, let him gain strength by habit; if you nurse him well, in time
      he will be strong. Him that you fear as a bull, as a calf you were wont to
      pat; the tree under which you are now reclining, was once a twig. A river
      at its rise is small, but it acquires strength in its course; and where it
      runs, it now receives many a stream. Make her become used to you; there is
      nothing more powerful than habit. While you are courting her, avoid no
      amount of trouble. Let her be always seeing you; let her be always lending
      ear to you; let both night and day show your countenance. When you have a
      greater confidence that you may be missed; then, destined to be her care
      when absent, go away to a distance. Give yourself some repose; the land
      that has lain fallow, gives back in abundance what has been entrusted to
      it; and the dry ground sucks up the water of the heavens. Demophoôn, when
      present, inflamed Phyllis in a less degree; when he had set sail, more
      violently did she burn. The crafty Ulysses, by his absence, tortured
      Penelope: far away, tearful Laodamia, was thy hero of Phylace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a short respite alone is safe; in time, cares become modified, and the
      absent love decays and a new one makes its entrance. While Menelaus was
      absent, Helen, that she might not lie alone, was received at night into
      the warm bosom of his guest. What meant, Menelaus, this stupidity of
      thine? Thou didst go away alone; under the same roof were both the
      stranger and thy wife. And dost thou entrust, madman, the timid doves to
      the hawk? Dost thou entrust the well-filled sheep-fold to the mountain
      wolf? Helen commits no sin; this paramour of hers does no wrong; he does
      what thou, what any one, would do. Thou dost persuade them to adultery, by
      giving both time and opportunity. What advice, but thine own, has the fair
      made use of? What is she to do? Her husband is away, and a guest, no
      repulsive person, is present, and she is afraid to sleep alone in an empty
      couch. Let the son of Atreus think better of it: I acquit Helen of
      criminality; she made use of the opportunity given by an easy husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither is the tawny boar so fierce in the midst of his rage, when he
      hurls the furious dogs with the lightning shock of his tusks; nor the
      lioness, when she is giving the breast to her sucking whelps; nor the
      little viper, when inhired by the heedless foot; as the woman, who is
      furious on detecting the rival of her nuptial couch, and bears on her
      features the proofs of her feelings. To the sword and to flames does she
      resort; and, shame laid aside, onward she is impelled, as though struck by
      the horns of the Aonian God. The barbarian fair one of Phasis avenged the
      fault of her husband, and the violated rights of a wife, by the death of
      her sons. See, how another cruel parent ('tis the swallow that you behold)
      has her breast stained with blood. 'Tis this breaks those attachments that
      are firmly united, this, those of long duration; these faults must then be
      guarded against by cautious men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, my judgment does not condemn you to one fair alone. The Gods
      forbid! hardly can the married woman adhere to this. Disport yourself; but
      let your faultiness be concealed by a decent stealthiness. No glory must
      be sought in one's own delinquency. And do you give no present of which
      the other may know; nor be there any stated times for your intriguing.
      And, lest the fair one should catch you in the retreat so well known to
      her, all must not be met in the same place of rendezvous. And, as often as
      you shall be writing, do you first examine the whole of the tablet; many a
      woman reads more than what has been sent to her. A slighted passion
      brandishes the arms of retribution, and hurls back the weapon, and causes
      yourself to complain of that of which it complained so lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as the son of Atreus was content with one woman, she, too, was
      chaste; through the fault of her husband did she become culpable. She had
      heard how that Chryses, bearing in his hand the laurel and the fillets,
      had not prevailed in behalf of his daughter. She had heard, too, ravished
      one of Lyrnesus, of thy sorrows; and how the warfare had been protracted
      through disgraceful delays. Still, these things she had only heard of; the
      daughter of Priam, herself, she had seen. Thou, the conqueror, wast the
      disgraced captive of thy own captive. Then did she receive the son of
      Thyestes, both into her chamber and her affections; and the daughter of
      Tyndarus avenged herself on a husband so deeply criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your actions, which you have studiously concealed, if perchance any of
      them are discovered, although they should be notorious, still do you
      always deny them. On such occasions, do you neither be subdued, nor more
      kind than usual. That bears the marks of a mind that has too deeply
      offended. Still, spare not any endearments on your side; peace is entirely
      centred in caresses alone; by these must the former intrigue be disavowed.
      There are some who would recommend you to use injurious herbs, such as
      savory; in my opinion they are so many poisons. Or else, they mingle
      pepper with the seed of the stinging nettle; <a href="#linknote-952"
      name="linknoteref-952" id="linknoteref-952"><small>952</small></a> and the
      yellow camomile pounded in old wine. But the Goddess, whom the lofty Eryx
      receives beneath his shady hill, does not allow us to be impelled in such
      manner to her delights. The white onion <a href="#linknote-953"
      name="linknoteref-953" id="linknoteref-953"><small>953</small></a> which
      is sent from the Pelasgian city of Alcathoiis, <a href="#linknote-954"
      name="linknoteref-954" id="linknoteref-954"><small>954</small></a> and the
      salacious herbs which come out of the gardens, and eggs may be eaten; the
      honey of Hymettus may be eaten, and the nuts which the pine-tree with its
      sharp leaves produces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, learned Erato, art thou thus diverging into the medical art? The
      inner side of the turning-place must be grazed by my chariot. You, who
      just now were, by my recommendation, to conceal your delinquencies, change
      your course, and, by my advice, disclose your intrigues. Nor yet is any
      inconsistency of mine to be censured; the curving ship does not always
      carry those on board with the same breezes. For sometimes we run with the
      Thracian Boreas, sometimes with the East wind; full aft does the canvass
      swell with the Zephyrs, with the South wind full aft. See how, in the
      chariot, the driver, at one moment, gives the flowing rein, at another,
      skilfully checks the horses in full career. There are some, with whom an
      anxious obsequiousness is ruinous, and if there is no rival existing, then
      their passion waxes faint. The feelings often run riot amid prosperity;
      and to bear good fortune with equanimity is no easy task. As the declining
      fire, its strength consuming by degrees, itself lies concealed, and the
      ashes become white over the surface of the fire; but still, when sulphur
      is applied, it finds the flames that were extinguished, and the light
      returns which existed before; so, when the feelings, sluggish through
      repose, and free from care, become torpid, by sharp stimulants must love
      be aroused. Make her to be jealous on your account, and rekindle her
      deadened feelings; let her turn pale at the proof of your inconstancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh four times blest, and so oft, that it is not possible to limit it to
      numbers, is that man, on whose account the slighted fair is in grief! who,
      soon as the charge has reached her unwilling ears, faints away: and both
      her voice and colour leave the sorrowing fair. Would that I were he, whose
      locks she tears in her fury; would that I were he, whose tender cheeks she
      tears with her nails; whom she looks upon bursting into tears; whom she
      beholds with scowling eyes; without whom she cannot exist; <i>but still</i>
      wishes that she could. If you enquire as to its duration: let the time be
      short for her to complain of her injuries, lest her anger may acquire
      strength in the slowly passing lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let her fair neck be encircled in your arms; and as she weeps, she
      must be received in your bosom. Give her kisses as she weeps: bestow her
      caresses as she weeps. Peace will ensue: by this method alone is anger
      appeased. When she has been passionately raving, when she shall seem to be
      an assured enemy; then seek your treaty of peace in caresses; she will
      then be pacified. For 'tis there that Concord dwells, all arms laid aside;
      'tis in that spot, believe me, that the Graces were born. The doves which
      fought the moment before, are now billing; their cooing has the meaning of
      caresses, and of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first <a href="#linknote-955" name="linknoteref-955"
      id="linknoteref-955"><small>955</small></a> there was a confused mass of
      things without arrangement; and the stars, the earth, and the ocean, were
      but of one appearance. Afterwards, the heavens were placed above the
      earth; the land was surrounded by the sea, and the confused Chaos was
      divided into its elements. The woods received the beasts, the air the
      birds as its possession; in the flowing waters, you, fishes were
      concealed. At that time the human race wandered in the solitary woods: and
      it consisted of nothing but brute force, and a mind quite uninformed. The
      woods were their houses, grass their food, and leaves their beds; and for
      a long time the one was unknown to the other. Voluptuous pleasure is said
      to have been the first to soften their rude dispositions; afterwards, the
      woman and the man settled in the same spot. What should they do?
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been instructed by no preceptor: Venus completed this delightful
      task without any art. The bird has an object to love: the female fish
      finds in the midst of the waters an object with which to share her joys.
      The hind follows her mate; the serpent couples with the serpent; the
      bitch, too, consorts with the dog. The delighted sheep unites with the
      ram; the heifer, also, is pleased with the bull; the fiat-nosed she-goat,
      too, receives her unclean mate. <a href="#linknote-956"
      name="linknoteref-956" id="linknoteref-956"><small>956</small></a> Mares
      are driven to frenzy, and follow the horses, separated by streams, over
      places far distant from each other in situation. Come, then, and give an
      efficacious remedy to the angered fair; 'tis that alone that puts an end
      to violent grief. 'Tis that remedy which excels the potions of Machaon; <a
      href="#linknote-957" name="linknoteref-957" id="linknoteref-957"><small>957</small></a>
      through that, when you have offended, you will have to be reinstated.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was thus singing, Apollo, suddenly appearing, touched with his
      thumb the strings of his lyre inlaid with gold. In his hands there was a
      laurel, placed on his holy locks there was a laurel: visible as a Poet he
      came. <a href="#linknote-958" name="linknoteref-958" id="linknoteref-958"><small>958</small></a>
      "Thou instructor in wanton Love," says he, "come, lead thy pupils to my
      temples. There is there a sentence celebrated in fame over the universal
      world, which bids each one to know himself. <a href="#linknote-959"
      name="linknoteref-959" id="linknoteref-959"><small>959</small></a> He who
      shall be known to himself, will alone love with prudence, and will
      proportion every task to his strength. He to whom nature has given beauty,
      for that let him be admired; he who has a fair complexion, let him often
      lie down with a shoulder exposed. He who charms with his discourse, let
      him break the quietude of silence; he who sings with skill, let him sing;
      he who drinks with elegance, <a href="#linknote-960" name="linknoteref-960"
      id="linknoteref-960"><small>960</small></a> let him drink. But in the
      middle of a conversation, neither let those who are eloquent declaim, and
      let not the insane poet be reciting his own compositions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Phoebus recommended; observe this recommendation of Phoebus. There is
      full confidence in the hallowed lips of this Divinity. I am now called to
      my more immediate subject: whoever shall love with prudence, he will prove
      successful, and will obtain from my skill what he shall require. The
      furrows do not always return with interest that which has been entrusted
      to them; nor does the breeze always aid the veering barks. What pleases
      lovers, is but a little: 'tis much more that crosses them; let them
      resolve to endure many things with their feelings. As many as are the
      hares on Athos; <a href="#linknote-961" name="linknoteref-961"
      id="linknoteref-961"><small>961</small></a> as the bees that feed on
      Hybla; <a href="#linknote-962" name="linknoteref-962" id="linknoteref-962"><small>962</small></a>
      as the berries which the azure-coloured tree of Pallas bears; as the
      shells on the sea-shore; so many are the pangs of love; the shafts which
      we endure are reeking with plenteous gall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, whom perchance you shall see, will be said to have gone out of doors;
      believe that she is gone out of doors, and that you make a mistake in your
      seeing. Is the door shut against you on the appointed night; endure even
      to lay your body on the dirty ground. Perhaps, too, the lying maid will
      say with a haughty air, "Why is that fellow blocking up our door?"
      Suppliantly entreat even the door-posts of the obdurate fair; and place at
      the door the roses that have been taken from off your head. <a
      href="#linknote-963" name="linknoteref-963" id="linknoteref-963"><small>963</small></a>
      Come when she desires it; when she shall shun you, you'll go away. It is
      not becoming for men of good breeding to cause weariness of their company.
      Why should your mistress be able to say of you, "There is no getting rid
      of this man?" The senses <a href="#linknote-964" name="linknoteref-964"
      id="linknoteref-964"><small>964</small></a> are not on the alert at all
      hours. And deem it no disgrace to put up with the curses of the fair one,
      or her blows, nor yet to give kisses to her delicate feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why dwell upon trifles? Let my mind be occupied with greater subjects.
      Of great matters will I sing; people, give all attention. I attempt an
      arduous task, but merit there is none, but what is secured by arduous
      means. By my undertaking are laborious attempts required. Endure a rival
      with patience; the victory will rest with yourself; you will be the
      conqueror on the heights of mighty Jove. <a href="#linknote-965"
      name="linknoteref-965" id="linknoteref-965"><small>965</small></a> Believe
      that not a mortal tells you this, but the Pelasgian oaks of Dodona: my
      skill has nothing superior to this to teach you. Does she make a sign to
      him, do you put up with it; does she write, don't you touch the tablets;
      let her come from whatever place she likes; and wherever she chooses, let
      her go. This do husbands allow to their lawful wives; even, too, when
      thou, gentle sleep, <a href="#linknote-966" name="linknoteref-966"
      id="linknoteref-966"><small>966</small></a> dost come to thy duty. I
      confess, that in this art I myself am not yet perfect. What must I do? I
      am myself unequal to my own precepts. And is any one in my presence to be
      making signs to my mistress? And am I to endure it? And is not my anger to
      hurry me away to any extreme? Her own husband <a href="#linknote-967"
      name="linknoteref-967" id="linknoteref-967"><small>967</small></a> (I
      remember it well) gave her a kiss; I complained of kisses being given; my
      love is brimful of fierceness. Not once alone has this failing proved an
      injury to me; he is more skilful, by whose encouragement other men visit
      <a href="#linknote-968" name="linknoteref-968" id="linknoteref-968"><small>968</small></a>
      his mistress. But 'tis still better to know nothing of it. Allow stealthy
      intrigues to lie concealed, lest the blush of confession should fly in
      future from her countenance when detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      With greater reason then, ye youths, forbear to detect your mistresses.
      Let them be guilty; and guilty, let them suppose that they have deceived
      you. When detected, the passion increases; when the fortune of the two is
      the same, each persists in the cause of the disgrace. There is a story
      told, very well known in all the heavens, how Mars and Venus <a
      href="#linknote-969" name="linknoteref-969" id="linknoteref-969"><small>969</small></a>
      were caught by the contrivance of Mulciber. Father Mars, distracted by a
      frantic passion for Venus, from a terrible warrior, became a lover.
      Neither did Venus (for, indeed, no Goddess is there more kind) proved coy
      or stubborn to Gradivus. O how many a time is she said, in her wantonness,
      to have laughed at the feet of her husband, and at his hands, hardened
      with the fire or his handicraft. In the presence of Mars, mocking him, she
      imitated her husband, and she was beauteous <i>even while so doing</i>;
      and many a grace was there combined with her charms. But they were in the
      habit of skilfully concealing their early intercourse; and their frailty
      was replete with modest propriety. Through the information of the Sun (who
      is there that can deceive the Sun?), the actions of his wife became known
      to Vulcan. Thou Sun, what a bad example thou art setting! Ask a bribe of
      her; and shouldst thou hold thy tongue, she has a favour which she may
      grant to thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around and above the bed, Muleiber disposes the hidden toils; the work, by
      its fineness, escapes their eyes. He pretends a journey to Lemnos; the
      lovers come, according to the appointment; entangled in the toils, they
      both lie naked. He calls the Gods together; the captives afford a
      spectacle. People believe that Venus could hardly restrain her tears. They
      cannot conceal their faces; they cannot, in fact, veil their modesty with
      their hands. Upon this, one says, laughing, <a href="#linknote-970"
      name="linknoteref-970" id="linknoteref-970"><small>970</small></a>
      "Transfer to me thy chains, most valiant Mavors, if they are a burden to
      thee." With difficulty, Neptune, at thy entreaty, does he release their
      captured bodies. Mars makes for Thrace, <a href="#linknote-971"
      name="linknoteref-971" id="linknoteref-971"><small>971</small></a> and she
      for Paphos. <a href="#linknote-972" name="linknoteref-972"
      id="linknoteref-972"><small>972</small></a> This, Vulcan, was done by
      thee; what before they used to conceal, they now do more openly, since all
      modesty is gone. Yet often, foolish one, dost thou confess that thou didst
      act unwisely; and they say that thou hast repented of thy wrath. This I
      have already forbidden: lo! Dione forbids you to suffer that detection
      which she herself endured. And do you arrange no toils for your rival; and
      intercept no words written by the hand in secret. Let the men seek for
      those, (if, indeed, they think they ought to be sought for) whom the fire
      and water render <a href="#linknote-973" name="linknoteref-973"
      id="linknoteref-973"><small>973</small></a> lawful husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold! again do I protest; no sportive subject is here treated of, but
      what is permitted by the laws; there is no matron concerned with my
      sallies. <a href="#linknote-974" name="linknoteref-974"
      id="linknoteref-974"><small>974</small></a> Who would dare to publish to
      the profane the rites of Ceres, <a href="#linknote-975"
      name="linknoteref-975" id="linknoteref-975"><small>975</small></a> and the
      great mysteries that were established in the Thracian Samos? 'Tis a small
      merit to hold one's silence upon matters; but, on the other hand, 'tis a
      grievous fault to speak of things on which we should be silent. O justly
      does it happen, that the blabbing Tantalus is thirsting in the midst of
      the water, the apples on the tree being caught at by him in vain! Cytherea
      especially bids her rites to be concealed. I recommend no talkative person
      to approach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mysteries of Venus are not enclosed in chests, <a
      href="#linknote-976" name="linknoteref-976" id="linknoteref-976"><small>976</small></a>
      and the hollow cymbals do not resound with frantic blows; although among
      ourselves they are celebrated by universal custom, yet it is in such a
      manner that among us they demand concealment. Venus herself, as oft as she
      lays her garments aside, conceals her groin with the left hand, <a
      href="#linknote-977" name="linknoteref-977" id="linknoteref-977"><small>977</small></a>
      a little bent back. The cattle couple in public and promiscuously; even
      when this is seen, full oft the fair one turns away her face. Chambers and
      doors are provided for our stealthy dalliance; and our nakedness lies
      concealed by garments placed over it. And if we do not require darkness,
      still we do something of a retired shade, and something less exposed than
      open day. In those times, even, when tiles did not as yet keep out the sun
      and the shower, but the oak was affording both shelter and food; in the
      groves and caves, and not in the open air, were shared the delights of
      love. So great was the regard for modesty, even in a savage race. But
      now-a-days we give praises to the exploits of the night; and nothing
      beyond the power of talking of it, is purchased at a heavy price. <a
      href="#linknote-978" name="linknoteref-978" id="linknoteref-978"><small>978</small></a>
      You will, for sooth, be discussing all the damsels in every quarter, that
      you may say to every person, "She, too, has been mine," that none may be
      wanting for you to point at with your fingers; and as you touch upon each,
      there will be a scandalous tale. But I am complaining of trifles; some
      pretend things, which, if true, they would deny, and not declare that
      there is not a woman from whom they have not received the last favour. If
      they cannot meddle with their persons, so far as they can, they meddle
      with their names; and, their persons untouched, their reputation bears the
      blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go now, odious keeper, and shut the doors of the fair: and add to the
      solid door-posts a hundred bars. What safety is there, while the defiler
      of character exists, and desires to be thought that he is that which it
      has not proved his lot to be? Even my real amours I confess but with
      reserve, and my secret intrigues are concealed with sure fidelity.
      Especially forbear to censure the blemishes of the fair; to many it has
      proved of advantage to conceal them. Her complexion was not made an
      objection against Andromeda by him, on whose two feet were the waving
      wings. <a href="#linknote-979" name="linknoteref-979" id="linknoteref-979"><small>979</small></a>
      To all others Andromache seemed of larger stature <a href="#linknote-980"
      name="linknoteref-980" id="linknoteref-980"><small>980</small></a> than
      was becoming; Hector was the only one who called her of moderate size.
      What you endure with impatience, accustom yourself to; and you will endure
      it with patience. Length of time makes many things endurable; but a rising
      passion catches sight of everything. While the young branch is uniting
      within the green bark, <a href="#linknote-981" name="linknoteref-981"
      id="linknoteref-981"><small>981</small></a> whatever breeze shakes it
      while now tender, it falls. Soon, hardened in time, the same tree will
      stoutly resist the winds, and bear the adopted fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time itself removes all blemishes from the person; and what was a fault,
      in lapse of time ceases so to be. The nostrils that are unaccustomed to
      it, are not able to endure the hides of bulls; the odour is not perceived
      by those that have been rendered used to it in length of time. We may
      palliate faults by names; let her be called swarthy, whose blood is
      blacker than the pitch of Illyria. If she has a cast in the eyes, she is
      like Venus: if yellow haired, like Minerva. She that is only half alive
      through her leanness, let her be grace ful. Whatever woman is small, say
      that she is active; her that is gross, call plump; and let each fault lie
      concealed in its proximity to some good quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      And don't you enquire what year she is now passing, nor under what
      Consulship <a href="#linknote-982" name="linknoteref-982"
      id="linknoteref-982"><small>982</small></a> she was born; a privilege
      which the rigid Censor <a href="#linknote-983" name="linknoteref-983"
      id="linknoteref-983"><small>983</small></a> possesses. And this,
      especially, if she has passed the bloom of youth, and her best years <a
      href="#linknote-984" name="linknoteref-984" id="linknoteref-984"><small>984</small></a>
      are fled, and she now pulls out the whitening hairs. This age, O youths,
      or even one more advanced, has its advantages; this soil will produce its
      crops, this is worth the sowing. While strength and years permit, endure
      labour; soon will bending old age come with silent foot. Either cleave the
      ocean with the oars, or the earth with the plough; or turn your warlike
      hands to cruel arms; or devote your strength and your attention to the
      fair. This, too, is a kind of warfare; <a href="#linknote-985"
      name="linknoteref-985" id="linknoteref-985"><small>985</small></a> this,
      too, seeks its advantages. Besides, in these <a href="#linknote-986"
      name="linknoteref-986" id="linknoteref-986"><small>986</small></a> there
      is a greater acquaintance with their subject; and there is long practice,
      which alone renders skilful. By attention to dress they repair the ravages
      of years; and by carefulness they cause themselves not to appear aged.

      One of the multitude may say, "Why add venom to the serpent? And why
      deliver the sheep-fold to the ravening wolf? Forbear to lay the
      culpability of the few upon the many; and let each fair one be considered
      according to her own deserts. If the younger son of Atreus has Helen, and
      the elder son of Atreus <a href="#linknote-1003" name="linknoteref-1003"
      id="linknoteref-1003"><small>1003</small></a> has the sister of Helen, to
      charge with criminality, if the son of Oclus, <a href="#linknote-1004"
      name="linknoteref-1004" id="linknoteref-1004"><small>1004</small></a>
      through the wickedness of Eriphyle, daughter of Talaion, alive, and with
      living steeds, descended to Styx; there is Penelope constant, while her
      husband was wandering for twice five years, and for as many years engaged
      in war. Witness the hero from Phylace, <a href="#linknote-1005"
      name="linknoteref-1005" id="linknoteref-1005"><small>1005</small></a> and
      her who is said to have descended as the companion of her husband, and to
      have died before her destined years. The wife from Pagasæ redeemed the son
      of Pheres <a href="#linknote-1006" name="linknoteref-1006"
      id="linknoteref-1006"><small>1006</small></a> from death, and in place of
      <a href="#linknote-1007" name="linknoteref-1007" id="linknoteref-1007"><small>1007</small></a>
      the funeral of her husband, the wife was carried out. "Receive me,
      Capaneus; we will mingle our ashes," said the daughter of Iphis, and she
      leapt on the midst of the pile. Virtue, herself, too, is a female, both in
      dress and name. 'Tis not to be wondered at, if she favours her own sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, 'tis not such dispositions as these that are required by my
      art. Sails of less magnitude are befitting my skiff. <a
      href="#linknote-1008" name="linknoteref-1008" id="linknoteref-1008"><small>1008</small></a>
      Nothing but wanton dalliance is taught by me; in what manner a woman is to
      be loved, I purpose to teach. The woman repels neither the flames, nor the
      cruel bow; those weapons, I see, make less havoc among the men. Many a
      time do the men prove false; not often the charming fair; and, if you make
      inquiry, they have but few charges of fraud against them. Jason, the
      deceiver, repudiated the Phasian, when now a mother; and into the bosom of
      the son of Æson there came another bride. <a href="#linknote-1009"
      name="linknoteref-1009" id="linknoteref-1009"><small>1009</small></a>
      Ariadne, left alone in an unknown spot, had fed the sea-birds, so far,
      Theseus, as thou wast concerned. Enquire why she is said to have gone on
      her nine journies, <a href="#linknote-1010" name="linknoteref-1010"
      id="linknoteref-1010"><small>1010</small></a> and hear how the woods
      lamented Phyllis, their foliage laid aside. And Elissa, she has the credit
      of affection; and still, that guest of thine, Elissa, afforded both the
      sword and the cause for thy destruction. Shall I tell what it was that
      ruined thee? Thou didst not know how to love; thou wast wanting in skill;
      through skill, love flourishes for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even still would they have been ignorant, but Cytherea commanded me to
      instruct them, and stood, herself, before my eyes. Then to me she said,
      "Why have the unfortunate fair deserved this? An unarmed multitude is
      handed over to the men in arms. Two treatises <a href="#linknote-1011"
      name="linknoteref-1011" id="linknoteref-1011"><small>1011</small></a> have
      rendered them skilful; this side, as well, must be instructed by thy
      advice. He who before had uttered <a href="#linknote-1012"
      name="linknoteref-1012" id="linknoteref-1012"><small>1012</small></a>
      reproaches against the wife from Therapnæ, soon sang her praises to a more
      fortunate lyre. If well I know thee, injure not the fair whom thou dost
      adore; their favour must be sought by thee so long as thou shalt live."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she said; and from the myrtle (for she was standing with her locks
      wreathed with myrtle) she gave me a leaf and a few berries. Receiving
      them, I was sensible of the divine influence as well; the sky shone with
      greater brightness, and all care departed from my breast. While she
      inspires my genius; hence receive the precepts, ye fair, which propriety,
      and the laws, and your own privileges, <a href="#linknote-1013"
      name="linknoteref-1013" id="linknoteref-1013"><small>1013</small></a>
      allow you. Even now, be mindful of old age, that one day will come; then
      will no time be passed by you in idleness. Disport yourselves, while yet
      you may, and while even now you confess to your true years; after the
      manner of the flowing stream, do the years pass by. Neither shall the
      water which has past by, be ever recalled; nor can the hour which has
      past, ever return. You must employ your youthful age; with swift step age
      is gliding on; and that which follows, is not so pleasing as that which
      having passed was charming. Those brakes, which are withering, I have
      beheld as beds of violets; from amid those brambles, has a beauteous
      chaplet been gathered for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time will be, when you, who are now shutting out a lover, will be
      lying, an old woman, chilled in the lonely night. No door <a
      href="#linknote-1014" name="linknoteref-1014" id="linknoteref-1014"><small>1014</small></a>
      of yours will be broken open in the broils of the night; nor will you find
      in the morning your threshold bestrewed with roses. <a
      href="#linknote-1015" name="linknoteref-1015" id="linknoteref-1015"><small>1015</small></a>
      How soon, ah me! are our bodies pursed with wrinkles, and that colour
      which existed in the beauteous face, fades away! The grey hairs, too,
      which you might have sworn that you had had from childhood, will suddenly
      be sprinkled over all your head. Old age is thrown off by serpents,
      together with the light slough; and the shedding of their horns makes the
      stags not to be old. Our advantages fly irretrievably; pluck the flowers
      then; if they be not plucked, they will lamentably fade themselves to your
      sorrow. Besides, child-bearing makes the hours of youth more short-lived;
      with continual crops the soil waxes old.

      Endymion of Latmus, O Moon, causes not thee to blush; nor was Cephalus a
      prey for the rosy Goddess to be ashamed of. Though Adonis be allowed to
      Venus, whom she yet laments; whence had she Æneas and Hermione <a
      href="#linknote-1016" name="linknoteref-1016" id="linknoteref-1016"><small>1016</small></a>
      for her children? Follow, O race of mortals, the example of the Goddesses;
      and refuse not your endearments to the eager men. Even should they deceive
      you, what do you lose? All remains the same. Were a thousand to partake
      thereof, nothing is wasted thereby. Iron is worn away, stones are consumed
      by use; your persons are proof against all apprehension of detriment. Who
      would forbid light to be taken from another light presented? Or who, on
      the deep sea, would hoard up the expanse of waters? "But 'tis not right,"
      you say, "for any woman to grant favours to a man." Tell me, what are you
      losing but the water, which you may take up again? <a href="#linknote-1017"
      name="linknoteref-1017" id="linknoteref-1017"><small>1017</small></a> Nor
      are my words urging you to prostitution; but they are forbidding you to
      fear evils that do not exist: your favours are exempt from loss to
      yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while I am in harbour, let a gentle breeze impel me, destined to sail
      with the blasts of a stronger gale. I begin with dress: <a
      href="#linknote-1018" name="linknoteref-1018" id="linknoteref-1018"><small>1018</small></a>
      from the well-dressed vine Bacchus has birth; and in the well-dressed
      field the high corn springs up. Beauty is the gift of the Divinity; how
      many a one prides herself on her beauty? Still, a great part <a
      href="#linknote-1019" name="linknoteref-1019" id="linknoteref-1019"><small>1019</small></a>
      of you is wanting in such endowments. Care will confer charms; charms
      neglected will perish, even though she be like the Idalian Goddess. If the
      fair of olden times did not pay such attention to their persons; neither
      had the ancients men so well-dressed. If Andromache was clad in a coarse
      tunic, what wonder is it? She was the wife of a hardy soldier. And would
      his companion, forsooth, come bedecked to Ajax, him whose covering was
      seven hides of oxen. Formerly a rustic simplicity existed: now gorgeous
      Rome possesses the wealth of the subdued earth. See the Capitol, what it
      now is and what it was, you would declare that they belonged to different
      Jupiters. The Senate-house, which is now right worthy of an assemblage so
      august, when Tatius held the sway, was made of straw. The fields of the
      Palatine hill, which are now resplendent in honour of Phoebus <a
      href="#linknote-1020" name="linknoteref-1020" id="linknoteref-1020"><small>1020</small></a>
      and our rulers, what were they but pastures for the oxen that ploughed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let old times delight others: I congratulate myself that I am born thus
      late; this is the age that is suited to my tastes. Not because the pliable
      gold is now dug out of the earth, and choice shells <a
      href="#linknote-1021" name="linknoteref-1021" id="linknoteref-1021"><small>1021</small></a>
      come here from foreign shores; nor yet because, the marble cut out,
      mountains diminish; nor yet because the azure waves are kept out by the
      moles. <a href="#linknote-1022" name="linknoteref-1022"
      id="linknoteref-1022"><small>1022</small></a> But because civilization
      prevails; and because the rude manners that flourished with our ancient
      forefathers have not come down to our days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But do not you as well load your ears with precious stones, which the
      tawny Indian seeks in the green waves. And do not go forth heavily loaded
      with clothes embroidered with gold: by the wealth through which you seek
      to attract us, you often drive us away. By neatness we are captivated; let
      not your hair be without arrangement; the hands applied to it both give
      beauty and deny it. The method, too, of adorning is not a single one; let
      each choose the one that is becoming it to her, and let her first consult
      her mirror. An oval face becomes a parting upon the unadorned head:
      Laodamia had her hair thus arranged. Round features <a
      href="#linknote-1023" name="linknoteref-1023" id="linknoteref-1023"><small>1023</small></a>
      require a little knot to be left for them on the top of the head, so that
      the ears may be exposed. Let the hair of another he thrown over either
      shoulder. In such guise art thou, tuneful Phoebus, thy lyre being assumed.
      Let another Lave her hair tied behind after the manner of well-girt Diana,
      as she is wont when she hunts the scared wild beasts. It becomes another
      to have her floating locks to flow loosely: another must be bound by
      fillets over her fastened tresses. Another it delights to be adorned with
      the figure of the tortoise <a href="#linknote-1024" name="linknoteref-1024"
      id="linknoteref-1024"><small>1024</small></a> of the Cyllenian God: let
      another keep up her curls that resemble the waves. <a href="#linknote-1025"
      name="linknoteref-1025" id="linknoteref-1025"><small>1025</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither will you count the acorns on the branching native oak, nor how
      many bees there are in Hybla, nor how many wild beasts on the Alps: nor am
      I able to comprehend in numbers so many modes; <i>each successive day
      brings a new fashion</i>. Even neglected locks are becoming to many; often
      would you suppose that they are lying neglected since yesterday; the very
      moment before they have been combed afresh. Let art imitate chance. 'Twas
      thus that, in the captured city, when Hercules beheld Iole; "Her," said
      he, "do I love." In such guise, deserted fair one of Gnossus, did Bacchus
      bear thee away in his chariot, while the Satyrs shouted Evôe! O how
      indulgent is nature to your beauty, whose blemishes can be atoned for in
      fashions so numerous! We men, to our misfortune, become bald; and our
      hair, carried away by time, falls off, like Boreas shaking down the
      leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The female stains her grey hair with the herbs from Germany; <a
      href="#linknote-1026" name="linknoteref-1026" id="linknoteref-1026"><small>1026</small></a>
      and by art a colour is sought superior to the genuine one. The female
      walks along, thickly covered with purchased hair; and for money <a
      href="#linknote-1027" name="linknoteref-1027" id="linknoteref-1027"><small>1027</small></a>
      she makes that of others&mdash;here comes those of fair complexion: black
      became the laughter of Brises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is she ashamed to buy it openly: we see it being sold before the eyes
      of Hercules <a href="#linknote-1028" name="linknoteref-1028"
      id="linknoteref-1028"><small>1028</small></a> and the Virgin throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      What am I to say on clothing? Gold flounces, <a href="#linknote-1029"
      name="linknoteref-1029" id="linknoteref-1029"><small>1029</small></a> I
      have no need of you; nor you, the wool which dost blush twice dipt in
      Tyrian purple. Since so many colours can be procured at a lower price,
      what folly it is to be carrying a fortune on one's person. <a
      href="#linknote-1030" name="linknoteref-1030" id="linknoteref-1030"><small>1030</small></a>
      Lo! there is the colour of the sky, at the time when the sky is without
      clouds, and the warm South wind is not summoning the showers of rain. Lo!
      there is the colour like to thee, that art said <a href="#linknote-1031"
      name="linknoteref-1031" id="linknoteref-1031"><small>1031</small></a> once
      to have borne away Phryxus and Helle from the treachery of Ino. That which
      resembles the waves, <a href="#linknote-1032" name="linknoteref-1032"
      id="linknoteref-1032"><small>1032</small></a> has its name, too, from the
      waves; I could imagine that the Nymphs are clad in vestments of this
      colour. Another resembles saffron; in saffron-coloured garments is the
      dewy Goddess dressed,when she yokes her steeds that bear the light of day.
      Another resembles the Paphian myrtles; another the purple amethysts, or
      the white roses, or the Thracian crane. Neither are there wanting,
      Amaryllis, <a href="#linknote-1033" name="linknoteref-1033"
      id="linknoteref-1033"><small>1033</small></a> thy chesnuts, nor yet
      almonds; and wax <a href="#linknote-1034" name="linknoteref-1034"
      id="linknoteref-1034"><small>1034</small></a> has given its own name to
      woollen textures.
    </p>
    <p>
      As many as the flowers which the renewed earth produces, when in warm
      spring the vine puts forth its buds, and sluggish winter retreats; so
      many, or still more, shades of dye does the wool imbibe. Choose them by
      rule; for every colour will not be suitable to every complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was carried off, then, too, was she clothed in a dark garment.
      White befits the swarthy; in white, daughter of Cepheus, thou wast
      charming; by thee, thus clothed, was Seriphos <a href="#linknote-1035"
      name="linknoteref-1035" id="linknoteref-1035"><small>1035</small></a>
      trodden.
    </p>
    <p>
      How nearly was I recommending you that there should be no shocking goat <a
      href="#linknote-1036" name="linknoteref-1036" id="linknoteref-1036"><small>1036</small></a>
      in the armpits, and that your legs should not be rough with harsh hair.
      But I am not instructing fair ones from the crags of Caucasus, and who are
      drinking, Mysian Caïcus, of thy waves. Besides; need I to recommend that
      idleness should not blacken your teeth, and that your mouth ought to be
      washed each morning with water used for the purpose. You know, too, how to
      find whiteness in an application of wax; <a href="#linknote-1037"
      name="linknoteref-1037" id="linknoteref-1037"><small>1037</small></a> she
      who is blushing with no real blood, is blushing by the aid of art. With
      skill do you fill up the bared edges of the eye-brows, <a
      href="#linknote-1038" name="linknoteref-1038" id="linknoteref-1038"><small>1038</small></a>
      and the little patch <a href="#linknote-1039" name="linknoteref-1039"
      id="linknoteref-1039"><small>1039</small></a> covers your cheeks in all
      their genuineness. 'Tis no harm, too, to mark the eyes <a
      href="#linknote-1040" name="linknoteref-1040" id="linknoteref-1040"><small>1040</small></a>
      slightly with ashes; or with saffron, produced, beauteous Cydnus, near to
      thee. I have a little treatise, <a href="#linknote-1041"
      name="linknoteref-1041" id="linknoteref-1041"><small>1041</small></a> but
      through the care bestowed, a great work, in which I have mentioned the
      various recipes for your beauty. From that as well, do you seek aid for
      your diminished charms: my skill is not idle in behalf of your interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let not your lover discover the boxes exposed upon the table; art, by
      its concealment only, gives aid to beauty. Whom would not the paint
      disgust, besmeared all over your face, when, through its own weight, it
      flows and falls upon your heated bosom? Why is the smell of the oesypum <a
      href="#linknote-1042" name="linknoteref-1042" id="linknoteref-1042"><small>1042</small></a>
      so powerful, sent from Athens though it be, an extract drawn from the
      filthy fleece of the sheep? Nor would I recommend you in his presence to
      apply the mixture of the marrow of the deer, <a href="#linknote-1043"
      name="linknoteref-1043" id="linknoteref-1043"><small>1043</small></a> nor
      before him to clean your teeth. These things will give you good looks, but
      they will be unbecoming to be seen; there are many things, too, which,
      disgusting while being done, add charms when done. The statues which now
      bear the name of the laborious Myron, <a href="#linknote-1044"
      name="linknoteref-1044" id="linknoteref-1044"><small>1044</small></a> were
      once a sluggish weight and a solid mass. That the ring may be made, the
      gold is first beaten; the clothes, that you are wearing, were once dirty
      wool. While it was being wrought, it was hard stone; now, as a beautiful
      statue, <a href="#linknote-1045" name="linknoteref-1045"
      id="linknoteref-1045"><small>1045</small></a> naked Venus is wringing the
      moisture from her dripping locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, too, while you are dressing, let us suppose to be asleep; after the
      finishing hand, you will be seen much more àpropos. Why is the cause of
      the fairness of your complexion known to me? Shut the door of your
      chamber, why expose the work half done? It is proper for the men to be in
      ignorance of many a thing. The greatest part of things would cause
      disgust, if you were not to conceal what is within. Examine the gilded
      statues which hang in the decorated theatre; how thin the tinsel that
      covers the wood. But it is not permitted the public to approach them
      unless completed; neither ought your charms to be heightened unless the
      men are at a distance. But I would not forbid you to allow your hair to be
      combed in their presence, so that it may be flowing along your back. Only
      take care especially on such occasions not to be cross; and do not many
      times undo your hair, pulled down, when fastened up. Let your coiffeuse be
      with a whole skin. I detest her who tears the face of her attendant with
      her nails, and who, seizing the hair-pin, pierces her arms. <a
      href="#linknote-1046" name="linknoteref-1046" id="linknoteref-1046"><small>1046</small></a>
      As she touches the head of her mistress, she curses it; and at the same
      time, streaming with blood, she is crying over the odious locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair one that has but little hair, let her set a watch on her
      threshold; or let her always make her toilet in the temple <a
      href="#linknote-1047" name="linknoteref-1047" id="linknoteref-1047"><small>1047</small></a>
      of the Good Goddess. I was unexpectedly announced as having paid a visit
      to a certain lady; in her confusion, she put on her locks the wrong side
      before. May a cause of shame so disgraceful fall to the lot of my foes,
      and may that dishonour happen to the Parthian dames. A mutilated animal is
      repulsive, the fields without grass are repulsive; and so is a shrub
      without foliage, and a head without hair. You have not come to be
      instructed by me, Semele, or Leda, thou, too, Sidonian fair, <a
      href="#linknote-1048" name="linknoteref-1048" id="linknoteref-1048"><small>1048</small></a>
      who wast borne across the sea upon the fictitious bull; or Helen, whom,
      Menelaus, not without reason, thou didst demand to be restored to thee,
      and whom, not without reason, thou Trojan ravisher, didst retain. A
      multitude comes to be instructed, both pretty and ugly damsels; and the
      unsightly are ever more in number than the good-looking. The beauteous
      care less for the resources and the precepts of art; they have their own
      endowments, charms that are powerful without art. When the sea is calm,
      the sailor rests free from care; when it becomes boisterous, he appeals to
      his own resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few, however, are the forms free from defect. Conceal your blemishes; and,
      so far as you can, hide the imperfections of your person. If you are
      short, sit down; that, while standing, you may not appear to be sitting;
      and if of a diminutive size, throw yourself upon your couch. Here, too,
      that your measure may not be able to be taken as you lie, take care that
      your feet are concealed with the clothes <a href="#linknote-1049"
      name="linknoteref-1049" id="linknoteref-1049"><small>1049</small></a>
      thrown over them. She who is too thin, let her wear clothes of thick
      texture; and let her vestments hang loosely from her shoulders. Let her
      who is pale, tint her complexion with purple stripes; <a
      href="#linknote-1050" name="linknoteref-1050" id="linknoteref-1050"><small>1050</small></a>
      do you that are more swarthy, have recourse to the aid of the Pharian
      fish. <a href="#linknote-1051" name="linknoteref-1051"
      id="linknoteref-1051"><small>1051</small></a> Let an ill-shaped foot be
      always concealed in a boot of snow-white leather steeped in alum; and do
      not unloose their laced sandals from the spindly legs. For high shoulders,
      small pads are suitable; <a href="#linknote-1052" name="linknoteref-1052"
      id="linknoteref-1052"><small>1052</small></a> and let the girth <a
      href="#linknote-1053" name="linknoteref-1053" id="linknoteref-1053"><small>1053</small></a>
      encircle the bosom that is too prominent. She whose fingers are dumpy, and
      whose nails are rough, should mark with but little gesture whatever is
      said. She, whose breath is strong smelling, should never talk with an
      empty stomach; and she should always stand at a distance <a
      href="#linknote-1054" name="linknoteref-1054" id="linknoteref-1054"><small>1054</small></a>
      from her lover's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your teeth are black, or large, or not, growing straight, you will
      suffer very great inconvenience from laughing. Who could have supposed it?
      The fair take lessons even in laughing; and even in that respect is
      gracefulness studied by them. Let your mouth be but moderately open; let
      the dimples on either side he but small; and let the extremity of the lips
      cover the upper part of the teeth. And do not let your sides be shaking
      with prolonged laughter; but let them utter sounds gentle and feminine, to
      I know not what degree. Some there are, who distort their face with an
      unsightly grin; another, when she is joyous in her laughter, you would
      take to be crying. Another makes a harsh noise, and screams in a
      disagreeable manner; just as the unsightly she-ass brays by the rough
      mill-stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      To what point does not art proceed? Some study how to weep with grace, and
      cry at what time and in what manner they please. Nay, further; when the
      letters are deprived of their full sound, and the lisping tongue becomes
      contracted with an affected pronunciation; then is grace sought in an
      imperfection; to pronounce certain words badly, they learn to be less able
      to speak than they really are. To all these points, since they are of
      consequence, give attention. Learn how to walk with steps suited to a
      female. Even in the gait, there are certain points of gracefulness not to
      be disregarded; this both attracts and repels men who are strange to you.
      This fair one moves her sides with skill, and with her flowing tunics
      catches the breeze, and haughtily moves her extended feet. Another walks
      just like the redfaced spouse of some Umbrian <a href="#linknote-1055"
      name="linknoteref-1055" id="linknoteref-1055"><small>1055</small></a>
      husband, and, straddling, takes huge strides. But, as in many other
      things, let there be a medium here as well; one movement is clownish;
      another movement will be too mincing in its gait. But let the lower part
      of your shoulders, and the upper part of your arm be bare, to be beheld
      from your left hand upwards. This is especially becoming to you, ye of
      fair complexion; when I see this, I have always a longing to give a kiss
      to the shoulder, where it is exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sirens were monsters of the deep, which with their tuneful voices
      detained the ships, even though in full career. On hearing them, the son
      of Sisyphus <a href="#linknote-1056" name="linknoteref-1056"
      id="linknoteref-1056"><small>1056</small></a> almost released his body
      from the mast; for the wax <a href="#linknote-1057" name="linknoteref-1057"
      id="linknoteref-1057"><small>1057</small></a> was melted in the ears of
      his companions. The voice is an insinuating quality; let the fair learn
      how to sing. In place of beauty, her voice has proved the recommendation
      of many a woman. And sometimes let them repeat what they have heard in the
      marble theatres; and sometimes the songs attuned to the measures of the
      Nile. <a href="#linknote-1058" name="linknoteref-1058"
      id="linknoteref-1058"><small>1058</small></a> Neither, in my way of
      thinking, ought a clever woman to be ignorant how to hold the plectrum <a
      href="#linknote-1059" name="linknoteref-1059" id="linknoteref-1059"><small>1059</small></a>
      in her right hand, the lyre in her left. Orpheus of Rhodope with his lyre
      moved rocks, and wild beasts, and the lakes of Tartarus, and Cerberus the
      triple dog. At thy singing, most righteous avenger of thy mother, <a
      href="#linknote-1060" name="linknoteref-1060" id="linknoteref-1060"><small>1060</small></a>
      the attentive stones built up the walls. The fish, (the well-known story
      of the lyre of Arion, <a href="#linknote-1061" name="linknoteref-1061"
      id="linknoteref-1061"><small>1061</small></a> although he was dumb, is
      supposed to have been moved by his voice. Learn, too, to sweep the chords
      of the festive psaltery <a href="#linknote-1062" name="linknoteref-1062"
      id="linknoteref-1062"><small>1062</small></a> with your two hands; 'tis an
      instrument suited to amorous lays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the songs of Callimachus <a href="#linknote-1063"
      name="linknoteref-1063" id="linknoteref-1063"><small>1063</small></a> be
      known to you, let those of the poet of Cos, <a href="#linknote-1064"
      name="linknoteref-1064" id="linknoteref-1064"><small>1064</small></a> let
      the Teian Muse too, of the drunken old bard. Let Sappho, too, be well
      known; for what is there more exciting than she? Or than him, through whom
      <a href="#linknote-1065" name="linknoteref-1065" id="linknoteref-1065"><small>1065</small></a>
      the father is deceived by the tricks of the crafty Geta? You may, too,
      have read the poems of the tender Propertius, <a href="#linknote-1066"
      name="linknoteref-1066" id="linknoteref-1066"><small>1066</small></a> or
      something of Gallus, or thy works, Tibullus. <a href="#linknote-1067"
      name="linknoteref-1067" id="linknoteref-1067"><small>1067</small></a> The
      fleece, too, so bewailed, O Phryxus, of thy sister, shining with its
      yellow hair, celebrated by Varro. <a href="#linknote-1068"
      name="linknoteref-1068" id="linknoteref-1068"><small>1068</small></a> The
      exiled Æneas, as well, the first origin of lofty Rome, <a
      href="#linknote-1069" name="linknoteref-1069" id="linknoteref-1069"><small>1069</small></a>
      than which no work exists in Latium of greater fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, too, my name will be mingled among these, and my writings will
      not be consigned to the waters of Lethe. And people will one day say,
      "Read the elegant lines of our master, in which he instructs the two
      sides. <a href="#linknote-1070" name="linknoteref-1070"
      id="linknoteref-1070"><small>1070</small></a> Or of his three books, which
      the title designates as, 'The Amours,' choose a portion to read with
      skilful lips, in a languishing way. Or let his Epistles be repeated by you
      with well-modulated voice; this kind of composition, <a
      href="#linknote-1071" name="linknoteref-1071" id="linknoteref-1071"><small>1071</small></a>
      unknown to others, did he invent." O Phoebus, mayst thou so will it; so
      too, ye benignant Divinities of the Poets, Bacchus, graceful with thy
      horns, and you, ye nine Goddesses!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can doubt that I should wish the falr one to know how to dance, that,
      the wine placed on table, she may move her arms in cadence, when
      requested. Masters of posture, <a href="#linknote-1072"
      name="linknoteref-1072" id="linknoteref-1072"><small>1072</small></a> the
      representations on the stage, are much valued; so much gracefulness does
      that pliant art possess. I am ashamed to advise on trifling points, to
      understand how to throw a cast of dice, and, thy value, the cube when
      thrown. And now let her throw the three numbers; now let her consider, at
      which number she can cleverly enter most conveniently, and which one she
      must call for. <a href="#linknote-1073" name="linknoteref-1073"
      id="linknoteref-1073"><small>1073</small></a> And, with her skill, let her
      play not amiss at the hostilities of the pieces; <a href="#linknote-1074"
      name="linknoteref-1074" id="linknoteref-1074"><small>1074</small></a> when
      the single man perishes between his two enemies. How the warrior, too, <a
      href="#linknote-1075" name="linknoteref-1075" id="linknoteref-1075"><small>1075</small></a>
      wages the war when caught without his companion; and how the enemy full
      oft retreats on the path on which he has begun. Let the smooth balls, <a
      href="#linknote-1076" name="linknoteref-1076" id="linknoteref-1076"><small>1076</small></a>
      too, be poured into the open net; and not a ball must be moved but the one
      which you shall be lifting up. There is a kind of game, <a
      href="#linknote-1077" name="linknoteref-1077" id="linknoteref-1077"><small>1077</small></a>
      distributed into as many lines on a small scale, as the fleeting year
      contains months. A little table receives <a href="#linknote-1078"
      name="linknoteref-1078" id="linknoteref-1078"><small>1078</small></a>
      three pebbles on each side, on which to bring one's own into a straight
      line, is to gain the victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devise a thousand amusements. 'Tis shocking for the fair one not to know
      how to play; many a time, while playing, is love commenced. But the least
      matter is how to use the throws to advantage; 'tis a task of greater
      consequence to lay a restraint on one's manners. While we are not
      thinking, and are revealed by our very intentness, and, through the game,
      our feelings, laid bare, are exposed; anger arises, a disgraceful failing,
      and the greed for gain; quarrels, too, and strife, and, then, bitter
      regrets. Recriminations are uttered; the air resounds with the brawl, and
      every one for himself invokes the angry Divinities. There is no trusting
      <a href="#linknote-1079" name="linknoteref-1079" id="linknoteref-1079"><small>1079</small></a>
      the tables, and, amid vows, new tables are called for; full oft, too, have
      I seen cheeks wet with tears. May Jupiter avert from you indiscretions so
      unbecoming, you, who have a care to be pleasing to any lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the fair, has nature, in softer mood, assigned these amusements; with
      materials more abundant do the men disport. They have both the flying
      ball, <a href="#linknote-1080" name="linknoteref-1080"
      id="linknoteref-1080"><small>1080</small></a> and the javelin, and the
      hoop, and arms, and the horse trained to go round the ring. No plain of
      Mars receives you, nor does the spring of the Virgin, <a
      href="#linknote-1081" name="linknoteref-1081" id="linknoteref-1081"><small>1081</small></a>
      so intensely cold; nor does the Etrurian <a href="#linknote-1082"
      name="linknoteref-1082" id="linknoteref-1082"><small>1082</small></a>
      river carry you along with its smooth stream. But you are allowed, and it
      is to your advantage, to go in the shade of Pompey's Portico, at the time
      when the head is heated by the steeds of the Constellation of the Virgin.
      <a href="#linknote-1083" name="linknoteref-1083" id="linknoteref-1083"><small>1083</small></a>
      Frequent the Palatium, consecrated to the laurel-bearing Phoebus;'twas he
      that overwhelmed in the deep the ships of Parsetonium. <a
      href="#linknote-1084" name="linknoteref-1084" id="linknoteref-1084"><small>1084</small></a>
      The memorials, also, which the Bister and the wife <a href="#linknote-1085"
      name="linknoteref-1085" id="linknoteref-1085"><small>1085</small></a> of
      our Ruler have erected; his son-in-law <a href="#linknote-1086"
      name="linknoteref-1086" id="linknoteref-1086"><small>1086</small></a> too,
      his head encircled with naval honors. Frequent the altars of the Memphian
      heifer, <a href="#linknote-1087" name="linknoteref-1087"
      id="linknoteref-1087"><small>1087</small></a> that smoke with
      frankincense; frequent the three Theatres, <a href="#linknote-1088"
      name="linknoteref-1088" id="linknoteref-1088"><small>1088</small></a> in
      conspicuous positions. Let the sand, stained with the warm blood, have you
      for spectators; the goal, also, to be passed with the glowing wheels. <a
      href="#linknote-1089" name="linknoteref-1089" id="linknoteref-1089"><small>1089</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      That which lies hid is unknown; for what is not known there is no desire.
      All advantage is lost, when a pretty face is without one to see it. Were
      you to excel even Thamyras <a href="#linknote-1090" name="linknoteref-1090"
      id="linknoteref-1090"><small>1090</small></a> and Amcebeus in your
      singing, there would be no great regard for your lyre, while unknown. If
      Apelles of Cos <a href="#linknote-1091" name="linknoteref-1091"
      id="linknoteref-1091"><small>1091</small></a> had never painted Venus, she
      would have lain concealed beneath the ocean waves. What but fame alone is
      sought by the hallowed Poets? The sum of all my labours has that crowning
      object. In former days, Poets were <a href="#linknote-1092"
      name="linknoteref-1092" id="linknoteref-1092"><small>1092</small></a> the
      care of rulers and of kings; and the choirs of old received great rewards.
      Hallowed was the dignity, and venerable the name of the Poets; and upon
      them great riches were often bestowed. Ennius, born in the mountains of
      Calabria, was deemed worthy, great Scipio, to be placed near to thee. <a
      href="#linknote-1093" name="linknoteref-1093" id="linknoteref-1093"><small>1093</small></a>
      At the present day, the ivy lies abandoned, without any honor; and the
      laborious anxiety that toils for the learned Muses, receives the
      appellation of idleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But be it our study to lie on the watch for fame; who would have known of
      Homer, if the Iliad, a never-dying work, had lain concealed? Who would
      have known of Danâe, if she had been for ever shut up, and if, till an old
      woman, she had continued concealed in her tower? The throng, ye beauteous
      fair, is advantageous to you; turn your wandering steps full oft beyond
      your thresholds. The she-wolf goes on her way to the many sheep, that she
      may carry off but one; and the bird of Jove pounces down upon the many
      birds. Let the handsome woman, too, present herself to be seen by the
      public; out of so many, perhaps there will be one for her to attract. In
      all places, let her ever be desirous to please; and, with all attention,
      let her have a care for her charms. Chance is powerful everywhere; let
      your hook be always hanging ready. In waters where you least think it,
      there will be a fish. Many a time do the hounds wander in vain over the
      woody mountains; and sometimes the stag falls in the toils, with no one to
      pursue him. What was there for Andromeda, when bound, less to hope for,
      than that her tears could possibly charm any one? Many a time, at the
      funeral of a husband, is another husband found. To go with the tresses
      dishevelled, and not to withhold your lamentations, is becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      But avoid those men who make dress and good looks their study; and who
      arrange their locks, each in its own position. What they say to you, they
      have repeated to a thousand damsels. Their love is roving, and remains
      firm in no one spot. What is the woman to do, when the man, himself, is
      still more effeminate, and himself perchance may have still more male
      admirers?
    </p>
    <p>
      You will hardly believe me, but still, do believe me; Troy would have been
      still remaining, if it had followed the advice of its own Priam. <a
      href="#linknote-1094" name="linknoteref-1094" id="linknoteref-1094"><small>1094</small></a>
      There are some men who range about, under a fictitious appearance of love,
      and, by means of such introductions, seek disgraceful lucre. And do not
      let the locks deceive you, shining much with the liquid nard; <a
      href="#linknote-1095" name="linknoteref-1095" id="linknoteref-1095"><small>1095</small></a>
      nor yet the narrow belt, <a href="#linknote-1096" name="linknoteref-1096"
      id="linknoteref-1096"><small>1096</small></a> pressed upon the folds of
      their dress. Nor let the robe of finest texture beguile you; nor yet if
      there shall be many and many a ring <a href="#linknote-1097"
      name="linknoteref-1097" id="linknoteref-1097"><small>1097</small></a> on
      their fingers. Perhaps the best dressed of the number of these may be some
      thief, <a href="#linknote-1098" name="linknoteref-1098"
      id="linknoteref-1098"><small>1098</small></a> and may be attracted by a
      desire for your clothes. "Give me back my property!" full oft do the
      plundered fair ones cry; "Give me back my property!" the whole Forum
      resounding with their cries. Thou, Venus, <a href="#linknote-1099"
      name="linknoteref-1099" id="linknoteref-1099"><small>1099</small></a>
      unmoved, and you, ye Goddesses, <a href="#linknote-1101"
      name="linknoteref-1101" id="linknoteref-1101"><small>1101</small></a> Hear
      the Appian way, from your temples blazing with plenteous gold, behold
      these disputes. There are even certain names notorious by a reputation
      that admits of no doubt; those females who have been deceived by many,
      share the criminality of their favorites. Learn, then, from the complaints
      of others, to have apprehensions for yourselves; and do not let your door
      be open to the knavish man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refrain, Cecropian fair, from believing Theseus, <a href="#linknote-1102"
      name="linknoteref-1102" id="linknoteref-1102"><small>1102</small></a> when
      he swears; the Gods whom he will make his witnesses, he has made so
      before. And no trust is there left for thee, Demophoôn, heir to the
      criminality of Theseus, since Phyllis has been deceived. If they are
      lavish of their promises, in just as many words do you promise them; if
      they give, do you, too, give the promised favours. That woman could
      extinguish the watchful flames of Vesta, and could bear off the sacred
      things, daughter of Inachus, <a href="#linknote-1103"
      name="linknoteref-1103" id="linknoteref-1103"><small>1103</small></a> from
      thy temples, and could administer to her husband the aconite, mixed with
      the pounded hemlock, if on receiving a present she could deny a favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      My feelings are prompting me to go too close; check the rein, my Muse: and
      be not hurled headlong by the wheels in their full career. Should lines,
      written on the tablets made of fir, try the soundings; let a maid suited
      for the duty take in the billets that are sent. Examine them; and collect
      from the words themselves, whether he only pretends what you are reading,
      or whether he entreats anxiously, and with sincerity. And after a short
      delay, write an answer: delay ever stimulates those in love, if it lasts
      only for a short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither do you make yourself too cheap to the youth who entreats, nor
      yet refuse, with disdainful lips, what he is pressing for. Cause him both
      to fear and to hope at the same moment; and oft as you refuse him, let
      hopes more assured, and diminished apprehensions arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write your words, ye fair, in a legible hand, but of common parlance, and
      such as are usual; the recognized forms of language are most pleasing.&mdash;Ah!
      how oft has the wavering lover been inflamed by a letter, and how oft has
      uncouth language proved detrimental to, a graceful form! But since,
      although you are without the honors of the fillet of chastity, it is still
      your care to deceive your husbands; <a href="#linknote-1104"
      name="linknoteref-1104" id="linknoteref-1104"><small>1104</small></a> let
      the skilled hand of a maid, or of a boy, carry the tablets, and don't
      entrust your pledges to some unknown youth. I myself have seen the fair
      pale with terror on that account, enduring, in their misery, servitude to
      all future time. Perfidious, indeed, is he who retains such pledges: but
      still in them he has power equal to the lightnings of Ætna.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion deceit is allowable, for the purpose of repelling deceit;
      and the laws permit us to take up arms against the armed. One hand should
      be accustomed to write in numerous styles. Perdition to those, through
      whom this advice must be given by me! Nor is it safe to write, except when
      the wax is quite smoothed over; so that the same tablet may not contain
      two hands. <a href="#linknote-1105" name="linknoteref-1105"
      id="linknoteref-1105"><small>1105</small></a> Let your lover be always
      styled a female when you write; in your billets let that be "she," which
      really is "he."
    </p>
    <p>
      But I wish to turn my attention from trifles to things of more
      consequence, and with swelling canvass to expand my filling sails. It
      conduces to good looks to restrain habits of anger. Fair peace becomes
      human beings, savage fury wild beasts. With fury the features swell; with
      blood the veins grow black; the eyes flash more wildly than the Gorgonian
      fires. "Pipe, hence avaunt, <a href="#linknote-1106"
      name="linknoteref-1106" id="linknoteref-1106"><small>1106</small></a> thou
      art not of so much worth to me," said Pallas, when she saw her features in
      the stream. You, too, if you were to look at your mirror in the midst of
      your anger, hardly could any one distinctly recognize her own countenance.
      And, in no less degree, let not a repulsive haughtiness sit upon your
      features; by alluring eyes love must be enticed. Believe me, ye fair who
      know it by experience, I hate immoderate conceit. Full oft do the features
      in silence contain the germs of hatred. Look at him who looks on you;
      smile sweetly in return to him who smiles. Does he nod at you; do you,
      too, return the sign well understood. When the Boy Cupid has made these
      preludes, laying aside his foils, he takes his sharp arrows from his
      quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate the melancholy damsels too. Let Ajax be charmed with Tecmessa; <a
      href="#linknote-1107" name="linknoteref-1107" id="linknoteref-1107"><small>1107</small></a>
      us, a joyous throng, the cheerful woman captivates. Never should I have
      asked thee, Andromache, nor thee, Tecmessa, that one of you would be my
      mistress. I seem hardly ably to believe it, though by your fruitfulness I
      am obliged to believe it, that you could have granted your favours to your
      husbands. And could, forsooth, that most melancholy woman say to Ajax, "My
      life!" and words which are wont to please the men?
    </p>
    <p>
      What forbids me to apply illustrations from great matters to small ones,
      and not to be standing in awe of the name of a general? To this person the
      skilful general has entrusted a hundred to be ruled with the twig of vine;
      <a href="#linknote-1108" name="linknoteref-1108" id="linknoteref-1108"><small>1108</small></a>
      to this one so many cavalry; to that one he has given the standard to
      defend. Do you, too, consider, to what use each of us is suited, and class
      each one in his assigned position. Let the rich man give his presents; let
      him that professes the law, defend; the eloquent man may often plead the
      cause of his client. We who compose verse, verses alone let us contribute.
      This throng, before all others, is susceptible of love. Far and wide do we
      herald the praises of the beauty that pleases us. Nemesis <a
      href="#linknote-1109" name="linknoteref-1109" id="linknoteref-1109"><small>1109</small></a>
      has fame; Cynthia, too, has fame. The West and the lands of the East know
      of Lycoris: and many a one is enquiring who my Corinna is. Besides, all
      deceit is wanting in the hallowed. Poets, and even our art contributes to
      forming our manners. No ambition influences us, no love of gain; despising
      the Courts, the couch and the shade are the objects of our commendation.
      But we are easily attracted, and are consumed by a lasting heat; and we
      know how to love with a constancy most enduring. Indeed, we have our
      feelngs softened by the gentle art; and our manners are in conformity with
      our pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be kind, ye fair, to the Aonian bards. In them there is inspiration, and
      the Pierian maids show favour unto them. In us a Divinity exists: and we
      have intercourse with the heavens. From the realms of the skies does that
      inspiration proceed. 'Tis a crime to look for a present from the learned
      Poets. Ah wretched me! of this crime no fair one stands in dread. Still,
      do act the dissemblers, and at the very first sight, do not be ravenous.
      On seeing your nets, a new lover will stop short. But neither can the
      rider manage with the same reins the horse which has but lately felt the
      bridle, and that which is well-trained; nor yet must the same path be trod
      by you in order to captivate the feelings that are steadied by years, and
      inexperienced youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter is raw, and now for the first time known in the camp of Love,
      who, a tender prey, has reached your chamber; with you alone is he
      acquainted; to you alone would he ever prove constant. Shun a rival; so
      long as you alone shall possess him, you will be the conqueror. Both
      sovereignties and love do not last long with one to share in them. The
      other, the veteran soldier, will love you gradually, and with moderation;
      and he will put up with much that will not be endured by the novice. He
      will neither break down your door-posts, nor burn them with raging flames;
      nor will he fly at the tender cheek of his mistress with his nails. He
      will neither tear his own clothes, nor yet the clothes of the fair; nor
      will her torn locks be a cause for grieving. These things befit boys, who
      are heated with youthful years and with passion: the other, with tranquil
      feelings, will put up with cruel wounds. With slowly consuming fires will
      he smoulder, just like a damp torch; or like the wood that has been cut
      down upon the mountain ridge. This passion is more sure; the former is
      short-lived and more bounteous. With speedy hand do you pluck the fruit
      that passes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let all points be surrendered; the gates we have opened to the enemy, and
      let confidence be placed in this perfidious betrayal. That which is easily
      conceded, but badly supports a lasting passion. A repulse must now and
      then be mingled with your joyous dalliance. Let him lie down before your
      doors: "Cruel door!" let him exclaim; and let him do many a thing in
      humble, many in threatening mood. The sweet we cannot endure; with bitter
      potions we may be refreshed. Full oft does the bark perish, overwhelmed by
      favouring gales. This it is that does not permit wives to be loved;
      husbands have access to them, whenever they please. Shut your door, <a
      href="#linknote-1110" name="linknoteref-1110" id="linknoteref-1110"><small>1110</small></a>
      and let your porter say to you with surly lips, "You cannot come in,
      desire will seize you as well, thus shut out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now lay aside the blunted swords; let the battle be fought with sharpened
      ones. And I doubt not but that I myself shall be aimed at with weapons of
      my own furnishing. While the lover that has been captured only of late is
      falling into your toils, let him hope that he alone has admission to your
      chamber. But soon let him be aware of a rival, and a division of the
      privileges of your favours. Remove these contrivances; and his passion
      will grow effete. Then does the high-mettled courser run well, the
      starting-place being opened, when he has both competitors to pass by, and
      those for him to follow. Harshness rekindles the flame, even if gone out.
      Myself to wit, I confess it, I do not love unless I am ill-used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the cause for grief should not be too manifest: and in his anxiety
      he ought to suspect that there is more than what he actually knows. The
      harsh supervision, too, of some feigned servant should excite him, and the
      irksome watchfulness of a husband too severe. The pleasure that is enjoyed
      in safety, is the least valued of all. Though you are more at liberty than
      even Thais, <a href="#linknote-1111" name="linknoteref-1111"
      id="linknoteref-1111"><small>1111</small></a> still feign apprehensions.
      Whereas you could do it far better by the door, admit him through the
      window; and on your countenance show the signs of fear. Let the cunning
      maid rush in, and exclaim, "We are undone!" and then do you hide the youth
      in his fright in any spot. Still, an enjoyment without anxiety must be
      interspersed with his alarms; lest he should not think your favours to be
      worth so much trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was about to omit by what methods the cunning husband may be eluded,
      and how the watchful keeper. Let the wife stand in awe of her husband; let
      the safe keeping of a wife be allowed. That is proper; that the laws, and
      justice, and decency ordain. But for you as well to be watched, whom the
      Lictor's rod <a href="#linknote-1112" name="linknoteref-1112"
      id="linknoteref-1112"><small>1112</small></a> has but just set at liberty,
      who can endure it? Come to my sacred rites, that you may learn how to
      deceive. Even if as many eyes shall be watching you, as Argus had, if
      there is only a fixed determination, you will deceive them all. And shall
      a keeper, forsooth, hinder you from being able to write, when an
      opportunity is given you for taking the bath? When a female confidant can
      carry the note you have penned, which her broad girth <a
      href="#linknote-1113" name="linknoteref-1113" id="linknoteref-1113"><small>1113</small></a>
      can conceal in her warm bosom? When she can conceal the paper fastened to
      her calf, and carry the tender note beneath her sandalled foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the keeper be proof against these <i>contrivances</i>; in place of
      paper, let your confidant afford her shoulders; and upon her own person
      let her carry your words. Letters, too, written in new milk, are safe and
      escape the eye; touch them with powdered coals, and you will read them.
      The writing, too, which is made with the stalk of wetted flax, <a
      href="#linknote-1114" name="linknoteref-1114" id="linknoteref-1114"><small>1114</small></a>
      will deceive, and the clean surface will bear the secret marks. The care
      of watching a fair one fell to Acrisius; still, through his own fault, did
      she make him a grandsire. What can a keeper do, when there are so many
      Theatres in the City? When, eagerly she is a spectator of the harnessed
      steeds? When she is sitting in attendance upon the sistra of the Pharian
      heifer, and at the place where her male friends are forbidden to go?
      While, too, the Good Goddess <a href="#linknote-1115"
      name="linknoteref-1115" id="linknoteref-1115"><small>1115</small></a>
      expels the gaze of males from her temples, except any that, perchance, she
      bids to come: while, as the keeper watches outside the clothes of the
      fair, the baths may in safety conceal the lovers who are hiding there;
      while, so often as is requisite, some pretended she-friend may be sick,
      and, ill as she is, may give place for her in her couch. While the false
      key, too, tells <a href="#linknote-1116" name="linknoteref-1116"
      id="linknoteref-1116"><small>1116</small></a> by its name what we are to
      do, and it is not the door alone that gives the access you require.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watchfulness of the keeper is eluded by plenty of wine; even though <a
      href="#linknote-1117" name="linknoteref-1117" id="linknoteref-1117"><small>1117</small></a>
      the grapes be gathered on the hills of Spain. There are drugs, too, which
      create deep sleep; and let them close the eyes overpowered by Lethæan
      night. And not amiss does the confidant occupy the troublesome fellow with
      dalliance to create delay, and in his company spins out the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      What need is there to be teaching stratagems and trifling precepts, when
      the keeper may be purchased by the smallest present? Believe me, presents
      influence both men and Gods: on gifts being presented, Jupiter himself is
      appeased. What is the wise man to do, when even the fool is gratified with
      a present? The husband himself, on receiving a present, will be silent.
      But once only throughout the long year must the keeper be bought; full oft
      will he hold out the hand which he has once extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      I complained, I recollect, that new-made friends are to be dreaded; that
      complaint does not extend to men alone. If you are too trusting, other
      women will interrupt your pleasures; and this hare of yours will be
      destined to be hunted down by other persons. Even she, <a
      href="#linknote-1118" name="linknoteref-1118" id="linknoteref-1118"><small>1118</small></a>
      who so obligingly lends her couch and her room, believe me, has not once
      only been in my company. And do not let too pretty a maid wait upon you;
      many a time has she filled <a href="#linknote-1119" name="linknoteref-1119"
      id="linknoteref-1119"><small>1119</small></a> her mistress's place for me.
      Whither, in my folly, am I led on? Why with bared breast do I strive
      against the foe, and why, myself, am I betrayed through information that
      is my own? The bird does not instruct the fowler in which direction he may
      be taken: the hind does not teach the hostile hounds how to run. Still,
      let interest see to itself; my precepts, with fidelity will I give. To the
      Lemnian dames, <a href="#linknote-1120" name="linknoteref-1120"
      id="linknoteref-1120"><small>1120</small></a> for my own destruction, will
      I present the sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give reason (and 'tis easy to do so) for us to believe ourselves to be
      loved. Belief arises readily in those who are anxious for the fulfilment
      of their desires. Let the fair one eye the youth in a kindly manner; let
      her heave sighs from her very heart, and let her enquire, why it is he
      comes so late? Let tears be added, too, and feigned apprehensions about a
      rival, and with her fingers let her tear her face. Soon will he be
      thoroughly persuaded, one? he will pity you of his own accord; and will
      say to himself "This woman is consumed by affection for me." Especially,
      if he shall be well drest, and shall please himself at the looking-glass,
      he will believe that the Goddesses might be touched with love for him.
      But, whoever you are, let an injury disturb you only in a moderate degree;
      and don't, on hearing of a rival, go out of your mind. And don't at once
      believe it; how injurious it is at once to believe things, Procris will be
      no slight proof to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is near the empurpled hills of blooming Hymettus a sacred spring,
      and the ground is soft with the verdant turf. The wood, of no great
      height, there forms a grove; the strawberry tree overshadows the grass;
      rosemary, and laurels, and swarthy myrtles give their perfume. Neither the
      box-trees with their thick foliage and the slender tamarisks, nor yet the
      tiny trefoil and the garden pine, are wanting there. Moved by the gentle
      Zephyrs and the balmy air, the leaves of these many kinds, and the tops of
      the grass quiver. Pleasant was this retreat to Cephalus; <a
      href="#linknote-1121" name="linknoteref-1121" id="linknoteref-1121"><small>1121</small></a>
      his servants and his hounds left behind, the youth, when weary, often sat
      down in this spot. And here he was in the habit of repeating, "Come,
      gentle Aura [breeze], to be received in my bosom, that thou mayst moderate
      my heat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some person, maliciously officious, with retentive lips carried the words
      he had heard to the timid ears of his wife. Procris, when she heard the
      name of Aura [breeze], as though of a rival, fainted away, and with this
      sudden apprehension she was mute. She turned pale, just as the late leaves
      become wan, which the coming winter has nipped, the clusters now gathered
      from the vine; and as the quinces <a href="#linknote-1122"
      name="linknoteref-1122" id="linknoteref-1122"><small>1122</small></a>
      which in their ripeness are bending their boughs; and as the cornels not
      yet quite fit for food for man. When her senses had returned, she tore her
      thin garments from off her body with her nails, and wounded her guiltless
      cheeks. And no delay was there; raving, with dishevelled locks, she flew
      amid the tracks, like a Bacchanal aroused by the thyrsus. When she had
      come near the spot, she left her attendants in the valley; and with silent
      footsteps, in her boldness, she herself stealthily entered the grove.
      What, Procris, were thy feelings, when thus, in thy frenzy, thou didst he
      concealed? What the impulse of thy disquieted breast? Each moment,
      forsooth, wast thou expecting that she would come, whoever Aura might be,
      and that their criminality would be witnessed with thine eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now dost thou repent of having come, for indeed thou wouldst not wish to
      detect him; and now thou art glad; fluctuating affection is tormenting thy
      breast. There is the spot, and the name, and the informant to bid thee
      give credence; and the fact that the lover always apprehends that to exist
      which he dreads. When she beheld the grass beaten down, the impress of his
      body, her trembling bosom was throbbing with her palpitating heart. And
      now midday had made the unsubstantial shadows small, and at an equal
      distance were the evening and the morn. Behold! Cephalus, the offspring of
      the Cyilenian God, <a href="#linknote-1123" name="linknoteref-1123"
      id="linknoteref-1123"><small>1123</small></a> returns from the woods, and
      sprinkles his glowing face with water of the fountain. In thy anxiety,
      Procris, art thou lying concealed. Along the grass he lies as wont, and
      says, "Ye gentle Zephyrs, and thou Aura [breeze], come hither." When the
      welcome mistake of the name was thus revealed to the sorrowing fair, both
      her senses and the real colour of her face returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arose; and the wife, about to rush into the embrace of her husband, by
      the moving of her body, shook the leaves that were in her way. He,
      thinking that a wild beast had made the noise, with alacrity snatched up
      his bow; his arrows were in his right hand. What, wretched man, art thou
      about? 'Tis no wild beast; keep still thy weapons. Ah wretched me! by thy
      dart has the fair been pierced. "Ah me!" she cries aloud, "a loving heart
      hast thou pierced. That spot has ever retained the wound inflicted by
      Cephalus. Before my time I die, but injured by no rival; this, O Earth,
      will make thee light when I am entombed. Now is my breath departing in the
      breeze that I had thus suspected; I sink, alas! close my eyes with those
      dear hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      In his sorrowing bosom he supports the dying body of his spouse, and with
      his tears he bathes her cruel wounds. Her breath departs; and gradually
      fleeting from her senseless breast, her breath <a href="#linknote-1124"
      name="linknoteref-1124" id="linknoteref-1124"><small>1124</small></a> is
      received into the mouth of her wretched husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us return to our path; I must deal with my subject undisguised,
      that my wearied bark may reach its port. You may be waiting, in fact, for
      me to escort you to the banquet, and may be requesting my advice in this
      respect as well. Come late, and enter when the lights are brought in;
      delay is a friend to passion; a very great stimulant is delay. Even should
      you be ugly, to the tipsy you will appear charming: and night itself will
      afford a concealment for your imperfections. Take up your food with your
      fingers; <a href="#linknote-1125" name="linknoteref-1125"
      id="linknoteref-1125"><small>1125</small></a> the method of eating is
      something; and do not besmear all your face with your dirty hand. And do
      not first <a href="#linknote-1126" name="linknoteref-1126"
      id="linknoteref-1126"><small>1126</small></a> take food at home; but cease
      to eat a little sooner than you could wish, and could have eaten. Had the
      son of Priam seen Helen greedily devouring, he would have detested her;
      and he would have said, "That prize of mine is an oaf."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is more proper and is more becoming for the fair to drink to excess.
      Thou dost not, Bacchus, consort amiss with the son of Venus. This too,
      only so far as the head will bear it, and the senses and the feet will be
      able to perform their duty; <a href="#linknote-1127"
      name="linknoteref-1127" id="linknoteref-1127"><small>1127</small></a> and
      do not see each object that is single, as double. A woman sprawling along,
      and drenched in plenteous wine, is a disgusting object; she is worthy to
      endure the embraces of any kind of fellows. And it is no safe thing when
      the tables are removed to fall asleep; in sleep many a shocking thing is
      wont to happen. I feel ashamed to instruct you any further, but genial
      Dione says, "That which shames you is especially my own province." Let
      each particular then be known unto you:

      attached to other buildings, and sometimes were independent of any other
      edifice. They were much resorted to by those who wished to take exercise
      without exposure to the heat of the sun. The Porticos of the temples were
      originally intended for the resort of persons who took part in the rites
      performed there. Lawsuits were sometimes conducted in the Porticos of
      Rome, and goods were sold there.]

      exhibited in the Circus or Amphitheatre, the water being introduced

      the wealthy Romans, had country seats: Seneca and Propertius refer to it
      as famous for its debaucheries, and it was much frequented by persons of
      loose character. It was the custom at Baiæ, in the summer-time, for both
      sexes to cruise about the shore in boats of various colours, both in the
      day-time and at night, with sumptuous feasts and bands of music on board.]

      were similar to our dice, while the 'tali,' which he next mentions, had
      only four flat surfaces, being made in imitation of the knuckle-bones of
      animals, and having two sides uneven and rounded. The dice were thrown on
      a table, made for the purpose, with an elevated rim. Some throws, like our
      doublets, are supposed to have counted for more than the number turned up.
      The most fortunate throw was called 'Venus.' or 'Venereus jactus'; it is
      thought to have consisted of a combination, making fourteen, the dice
      presenting different numbers. Games with dice were only sanctioned by law

      theft,' which is supposed to have been somewhat similar to our chess. He
      refers to its name in the words, 'latrocinii sub imagine.' The game was
      supposed to imitate the furtive stratagems of warfare: hence the men,
      which were usually styled 'calculi,' were also called by the name of
      'latrones,' 'latrunculi,' 'milites,' 'bella-tores,' 'thieves,' 'little
      thieves,' 'soldiers,' 'warriors.' As we see by the next line, they were
      usually made of glass, though sometimes more costly materials were
      employed. The skill of this game consisted either in taking the pieces of
      the adversary, or rendering them unable to move. The first was done when
      the adversary's piece was brought by the other between two of his own. See
      the Tristia, Book ii. 1.477. The second took place when the pieces were
      'ligati,' or 'ad incitas redacti,' brought upon the last line and unable
      to move. White and red are supposed to have been the colour of the men.
      This game was much played by the Roman ladies and nobles.]

      257. He alluded to a festival celebrated by the servants, on the Caprotine
      Nones, the seventh of July, when they sacrificed to 'Juno Caprotina.'
      Macrobius says that the servants sacrificed to Juno under a wild fig-tree
      (called 'caprificus'), in memory of the service done by the female slaves,
      in exposing themselves to the lust ot the enemy, for the public welfare.
      The Gauls being driven from the city, the neighbouring nations chose the
      Dictator of the Fidenates for their chief, and, marching to Rome, demanded
      of the Senate, that if they would save their city, they should send out to
      them their wives and daughters The Senate, knowing their own weakness,
      were much perplexed, when a handmaid, named 'Tutela,' or 'Philotis,'
      offered, with some others, to go out to the enemy in disguise. Being,
      accordingly, dressed like free women, they repaired in tears to the camp
      of the enemy. They soon induced their new acquaintances to drink, on the
      pretence that they were bound to consider the day as a festival; and when
      intoxicated, a signal was giver, from a fig tree near, that the Romans
      should fall on them. The camp of the enemy was assailed, and most of them
      were slain. In return for their service, the female, slaves were made
      free, and received marriage portion? at the public expense. Another
      account, agreeing with the present passage, says, that the Gauls were the
      enemy who made the demand, and that Retana was the name of the female
      slave.]

      of so highly injurious a tendency as melted wax.]
